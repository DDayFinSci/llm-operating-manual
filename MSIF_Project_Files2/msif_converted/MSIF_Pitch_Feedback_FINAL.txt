## Pitch A: Quantum Returns — Defensive Sector Systematic Strategy

Your presentation demonstrated strong conceptual grounding in defensive equity literature, particularly in recognizing that Novy-Marx reframes defensive outperformance as deriving from embedded profitability and value factors rather than low beta itself. The screening criteria — ROIC ≥ 9%, P/E ≤ 20, Market Cap ≥ $10B — appropriately operationalize this insight by targeting quality and value, not just volatility.

Your backtest (Slide 6) yielded 9.58% annual return with 0.43 Sharpe and -3.68% alpha against the S&P 500, which achieved 0.92 Sharpe over the same period. This apparent underperformance stems from benchmark mismatch, not strategy failure. Defensive strategies require defensive benchmarks — comparing your low-volatility portfolio to the S&P 500 mismatches risk profiles fundamentally. The MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Index would provide appropriate comparison, likely revealing positive risk-adjusted performance. Your "not compelling vs. benchmark" conclusion needs precision within the systematic framework: are you rejecting because (1) the strategy fails against an appropriate defensive benchmark, (2) current market conditions don't favor defensive positioning, or (3) the fund already holds sufficient low-volatility exposure?

Moving forward, run factor regression to quantify return attribution across market beta, quality, and value tilts. This validates whether your screens captured Novy-Marx's "unprofitable small growth exclusion" — the true driver of defensive outperformance. Additionally, present correlation analysis with existing systematic positions. If correlation exceeds 0.70, the strategy adds redundancy regardless of standalone merit. The systematic framework rewards discipline over discretion; ensure your recommendation reflects rules-based logic rather than performance disappointment against an inappropriate benchmark.

## Pitch B: 4 Risketeers — Quality Minus Junk (QMJ) Strategy

Your selection of Asness, Frazzini & Pedersen's QMJ framework demonstrates strong theoretical grounding, and your 10-year backtest results — 426% return vs. 314% for the S&P 500, with 0.94 Sharpe vs. 0.72 — validate the quality premium. The 2.90% annual alpha confirms your screens captured genuine factor exposure beyond market beta. Your recommendation to allocate $50,000 aligns with the systematic framework's mandate: clear screening criteria, positive risk-adjusted returns, and portfolio enhancement.

However, your implementation deviates from canonical QMJ construction in concerning ways. First, "Bottom 50% Debt to Assets" (Slide 5) contradicts quality investing — you want LOW debt firms, meaning you should screen for the bottom 50th percentile of debt ratios, not eliminate them. This phrasing suggests you may have inverted the filter. Second, using Free Cash Flow as your final ranking variable conflates cash generation with comprehensive quality. QMJ traditionally composites profitability, growth, safety, and payout metrics equally; your FCF concentration may inadvertently tilt toward mature cash cows rather than balanced quality.

The 28.85% quarterly turnover warrants cost-benefit analysis. At 115% annual turnover, transaction costs could erode your alpha substantially. Model this explicitly: if trading costs exceed 50bps per rebalance, your 2.90% alpha shrinks to statistical noise. Additionally, funding this strategy by selling your ultra-short bond position fundamentally changes portfolio risk. You're swapping a 0% beta asset for 0.97 beta exposure — quantify how this affects overall portfolio volatility and drawdown risk. The systematic framework demands you acknowledge these implementation frictions, not just backtest returns. Quality investing works, but operational details determine whether you capture theoretical premiums or donate them to market makers.
