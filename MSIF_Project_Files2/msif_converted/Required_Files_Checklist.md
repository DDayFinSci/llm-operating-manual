# Files NotebookLM Needs for Enhancement

## Essential Files (You Already Have)
✅ `quantum returns 11-10 systematic strategy - slide deck.pdf`  
✅ `4 risketeers 11-10 systematic strategy slide deck.pdf`  
✅ `MSIF_Pitch_Feedback_Paragraphs.txt` (Claude's draft to enhance)  
✅ `NotebookLM_Enhancement_Instructions.md` (detailed instructions)

## Faculty Feedback Patterns (At Least 2 Needed)
✅ `FINAL_Grade_Feedback__Cash_Flow_Crew_Systematic_Pitch_113.pdf`  
✅ `FINAL_Grade_Feedback__Ute_Capital_Systematic_Pitch_113.pdf`  
? `Cash_Flow_Crew_9825_Pitch__Final_Grade__Feedback.pdf`  
? `Final_Grade_SharpeEdge_102725_BABAFA.pdf`  

## Source Papers (Helpful but Optional)
✅ `NBER.pdf` (Novy-Marx)  
✅ `sourcepaper_4risketeers_syspitch_frazziniandpedersen.pdf`  

## Minimum Viable Set
If you have the 4 essential files + 2 faculty feedback PDFs, NotebookLM can deliver the 70% improvement probability. Additional feedback forms increase pattern recognition accuracy.
