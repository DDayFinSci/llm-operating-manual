Hello Professor Brogaard

Our investment thesis proposes a systematic tilt toward defensive sectorsâ€”primarily Health Care, Consumer Staples, and Utilitiesâ€”based on evidence from Novy-Marx (NBER, 2014)Â and Frazzini, Friedman & Kim (AQR, 2012).

  
This thesis builds on the low-risk anomaly, which shows that low-beta stocks consistently outperform high-beta stocks on a risk-adjusted basis, contradicting the traditional â€œhigher risk, higher returnâ€ paradigm. Defensive portfolios have historically achieved market-like returns with lower volatility and higher Sharpe ratios, making them ideal for long-term investors focused on capital preservationÂ and stable compounding.

1.Â Â Â Â Â Â Evidence

Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Across 1926â€“2011, low-beta portfolios delivered Sharpe 0.58 vs 0.38Â for the Russell 1000, about 53 % higher risk-adjusted performance, with drawdowns of 35.8 % vsÂ  51 %Â (AQR, 2012).

Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Frazzini & Pedersen (2014)Â show that for portfolios sorted by beta, Sharpe ratios decline monotonicallyÂ from the lowest-beta to the highest-beta portfolios, reinforcing the robustness of the Betting Against BetaÂ factor.

Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Since 1968, high-volatility/high-beta stocks, typically small, unprofitable, and growth-oriented, have shown the worst absolute returns, while defensive portfolios outperform mainly by avoiding these lossesÂ (Novy-Marx, 2014).

2.Â Â Â Â Â Â Defensive Sector Characteristics

Defensive sectors share key fundamentals: large capitalization, high profitability, low leverage, stable earnings, and low beta/volatility. They deliver strong and consistent ROE, net margins, and trade at moderate valuations. Health Care, Consumer Staples, and Utilities embody these â€œquality + profitabilityâ€ factors that underpin long-term resilience.

3.Â Â Â Â Â Â Why Invest Now â€“ Health Care Focus

Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Performance gap:Â S&P 500 (+13.7 % YTD 2025) vs. Health Care (â€“5 %), a 18 p.p. underperformance, the widest in over two decades (MarketWatch; Reuters, 2025).

Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Valuation:Â Health Care trades at a forward P/E â‰ˆ 17Ã—, 27 % belowÂ its five-year average (24Ã—) and 22 % belowÂ the S&P 500 (22.7Ã—). Free cash-flow yield > 5 %Â vs 3 % for the index.

Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Secular drivers:Â Aging population (+40 % ages 65+ by 2040), record >60 FDA approvalsÂ (2024), and digital health spending >US$ 380 bn (+13 % YoY).

Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Sentiment:Â >12 months of outflows reflect extreme pessimism; any stabilization or easing in regulatory rhetoric could trigger a re-rating.

Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Historical reversion:Â This is the largest relative underperformance in more than twenty years; historically, whenever Health Care has lagged by this magnitude, it has outperformed the market over the following 12â€“24 monthsÂ (Janus Henderson, 2025). The lag reflects a â€œrisk-onâ€ rotation toward technologyÂ and temporary regulatory pressures, not structural weakness in earnings

Â **Conclusion**

**The U.S. Health Care sector offers a compelling long-term entry point. After a sharp relative lag, it combines defensive fundamentals, discounted valuations, and secular growth catalysts. Within a systematic, low-beta framework, Health Care provides a favorable risk-reward profileâ€”positioned for mean reversion and sustained outperformanceÂ as macro conditions normalize.**

We respectfully request your approval to integrate defensive sectors, with an emphasis on Health Care, into our systematic analysis for the MSIF portfolioâ€™s long-term investment outlook.Â

Dear Diego,

Can you please share the articles?

This feels like it was written by chat gpt. Did you use Chatgpt in writing this email?

  
Best regards,

Jonathan

Good morning Professor Brogaard,

I am attaching the articles on which we have based our thesis.

The idea of using defensive sectors as a long-term strategy,Â  particularly in periods of uncertainty such as the current environment,Â  was developed by us, as well as the review of the referenced papers.

I used ChatGPT primarily to enhance the clarity of the emailâ€™s wording and to strengthen the articulation of the reasons to invest in the Health Care sector. However, all evidence data cited in our thesis are derived directly from the attached academic articles.

Regards,

Diego

Got it, thank you. I am very pro using Chatgpt, that being said, it should not sound like you are using it.

The novy marxÂ article actually argues against defensive stocks outperforming. Below is a quote from the introduction.

"This paper takes a more skeptical view. While reaffirming the poor absolute performance of the most aggressive stocks, it nevertheless shows that the performance of defensive equity strategies is explained by known drivers of cross-sectional variation in returns."

Good afternoon Professor Brogaard,

I apologize for my delayed response.

I would like to clarify our interpretation of article Novy Marx within the context of our systematic investment thesis. The article does not argue against the historical outperformance of defensive stocks ( which itâ€™s our investment thesis). In fact, the paper reaffirms a key premise of our thesis: defensive equity strategies have historically delivered superior performance compared to the most aggressive, high-beta stocks.

_Article Conclusion: â€œ Over the last 45 years defensive stocks have delivered higher returns than the most aggressive stocks, and defensive strategies, at least those based on volatility, have delivered significant Fama and French three-factor alphasâ€._

What Novy Marx challenges are the true drivers behind that outperformance. The paper demonstrates that the â€œdefensive premiumâ€ does not come from low beta itself, but rather from exposure to well established fundamental factors like size, profitability, and relative valuation among others. Most critically, however, the superior results arise from the systematic exclusion of unprofitable small growth firms, which have historically delivered the worst absolute returns in U.S. equity markets.

_Article Conclusion: This performance is not at all anomalous, however, after properly controlling for size, relative valuations, and, most critically, profitability. While investors would have benefited from a defensive tilt over the period, these benefits derive effectively from an unprofitable small growth exclusion,_

Therefore, as we shape our defensive systematic approach, it is essential that our screening criteria explicitly exclude unprofitable small growth firmsÂ and incorporate factor based filters such as size and profitability, ensuring that the strategy captures the fundamental drivers of long term, risk adjusted performanceÂ rather than relying solely on low volatility characteristics.

Of course, if you believe this line of reasoning is still insufficient, we would be more than happy to expand our research and incorporate additional academic sources.

Please let me know if I can clarify any aspect of this interpretation or further discuss its implications for our approach.

Dear Diego,

Thank you for the follow up.Â  So what would your quarterly / annual rebalancing criteria be?

Best regards,

Jonathan

Hello Professor Brogaard,

Based on the articles reviewed, for a company to be considered part of the defensive sector, it must meet several criteria:

1. Low beta

2. Strong and sustainable profitability over time

3. Stability in earnings and cash flows

4. Size

5. Reasonable valuations

Unfortunately, neither of the two articles provides specific quantitative thresholds for these criteria. However, they do offer a conceptual description of what is expected within each dimension. For instance, regarding a low beta, they do not state an exact number, but they do mention that it must be below the market,Â  Â which provides a reference point for setting an appropriate screening range.

Therefore, the proposed filters are as follows:

1. **Beta < 1:**Â since the portfolio should exhibit less volatility than the overall market

2. **ROIC > 9%:**Â Â while there is no consolidated ROIC published for the S&P 500 as an index, given its frequently changing components, a value above 9% can be considered close to the historical annual average sectors.

3. **CAGR EPS > 13%:**Â The typical range is 100.11 to 186.31; and the year-over-year growth is 13.1% according to:Â [https://www.gurufocus.com/economic_indicators/58/sp-500-earnings-per-share](https://www.gurufocus.com/economic_indicators/58/sp-500-earnings-per-share "https://www.gurufocus.com/economic_indicators/58/sp-500-earnings-per-share")

4. **Market Cap > $10B:**Â Â Qualifying as large cap companies

5. **P/E < 20**Â â€” derived from the historical valuation of the S&P 500 and especially the Healthcare sector

- Typical value range is 21.16 to 29.52 according:Â [https://www.gurufocus.com/economic_indicators/6061/sp-500-pe-ratio-with-forward-estimate](https://www.gurufocus.com/economic_indicators/6061/sp-500-pe-ratio-with-forward-estimate "https://www.gurufocus.com/economic_indicators/6061/sp-500-pe-ratio-with-forward-estimate")

These criteria will guide the development of our investment thesis focusing on defensive sectors such as Utilities, Consumer Staples, Telecommunications, and particularly Healthcare ( our primary sector in which we intend to concentrate our screening). If identifying 15 Healthcare companies meeting these strict filters proves difficult, we may extend the search to the other sectors mentioned.

Please let me know if you would suggest any adjustments or believe any additional variables should be included.
