Introduction to Student Investment Fund
Purpose and Structure of the Fund: The purpose of the student investment fund is to give
students real world experience actively managing a multimillion dollar investment fund. The
fund is structured into multiple portfolios being Milner, Davidson, ESG, and School which are
combined together to take a holistic view of managing one entire portfolio. Students looking for
more information can find additional explanations on both the Student Investment Fund website
as well as in the Fund Bylaws and Fund Constitution.
Expectations for Analysts
Analysts will be organized into 2 essential teams, their role and investment team. Both serve
separate purposes and will have their respective duties and presentations.
Roles
The roles team focuses on the administrative side of the fund ensuring things like proper
accounting, reconciliation, external communication, etc. are ensured. Some of the roles are
Social Team, Records Team, Website Team, Technology Team, Copy Editing Team, and Chief
of Staff.
● Social Team promotes the SIF, organizes guest speakers and SIF events like poker night
and manages the recruiting for next years SIF Cohort.
● Records Team ensures proper accounting and reconciliation of all trades, dividends,
interest, etc. They mainly make sure the portfolio is accurate and up to date.
● Technology Team updates the ticker board in SIF, helps students with databases like
Bloomberg and CAPIQ as well as fixing issues surrounding the portfolio tracker.
● Website Team is responsible for updating and maintaining the SIF website by uploading
new material.
● Copy Editing Team reviews and properly formats all of the presentations and other
information that will be published to the public. They are also responsible for organizing
the end of year presentation and report.
● Chief of Staff is one of the most important roles which is held by a single student. This
student acts as a bridge between the fund and Professor Brogaard. The Chief of Staff
provides class sentiment and feedback to the professor and also acts as a pivot role who
can support any of the other teams when needed.

Investment Teams
The investment teams are chosen within the first few weeks of SIF. Students will learn about one
another and create investment teams with 3-4 students per group. In these groups you will
conduct research and create investment pitches that will be presented in class. The pitches focus
on fundamental, systematic, and economic strategies and pitches. The pitches are usually given
every 4 weeks and take a significant amount of time, failure, and learning along the way.
Overview of the Decision-Making Process
The SIF is student run meaning the decision making process comes down to an entire class vote
on whether a motion should pass or not. Typically votes surround the portfolio with what certain
risk metrics should be targeted as well as whether an investment pitch should be passed and
adopted into the fund or not.

Fundamentals of Financial Markets
Equity vs. Fixed Income Markets
What Is It?
Financial markets are broadly divided into two major categories: equity markets and fixed
income markets, each representing a distinct type of financial instrument and investment
approach.
Equity Markets
The equity market (or stock market) is where shares of ownership in publicly traded companies
are issued and traded. Investors in the equity market buy and sell stocks, which represent
fractional ownership in a corporation. Stockholders are entitled to a portion of the company’s
earnings and assets, often realized through capital appreciation and dividends. Common
stockholders also have voting rights, although these vary depending on the share class.
Equity securities are traded on organized exchanges such as:
● New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
● Nasdaq
● London Stock Exchange (LSE)
● Or through electronic communication networks (ECNs) and over-the-counter (OTC)
markets.
Fixed Income Markets
The fixed income market involves the trading of debt securities, most commonly bonds. When
investors buy bonds, they are lending money to the issuer (a corporation, municipality, or
government) in exchange for regular interest payments (called coupons) and the return of the
principal (also called face value or par value) at maturity.
Types of fixed income instruments include:
● Treasury Bonds (issued by the U.S. government)
● Municipal Bonds (issued by state and local governments)
● Corporate Bonds
● Asset-Backed Securities (ABS) and Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)
Unlike stocks, bondholders do not own a part of the company and do not have voting rights, but
they are senior to equity holders in the event of bankruptcy.
Why Is It Important?

Understanding the differences between equity and fixed income markets is essential for sound
investment strategy, as each asset class contributes differently to a portfolio in terms of return,
risk, liquidity, and income.
This balance makes asset allocation critical. Equities help grow wealth over time, while fixed
income protects capital and provides steady cash flows.
How Is It Used in This Class?
In this course, students must understand and apply the principles of both equity and fixed income
markets to construct and manage a diversified portfolio.
Primary vs. Secondary Markets
What Is It?
Financial markets are divided into primary and secondary markets, each playing a unique role in
the lifecycle of a security and the broader capital markets ecosystem.
Primary Market
The primary market is where new securities are created and sold for the first time. This market
enables issuers (such as companies or governments) to raise capital directly from investors. A
key example of a primary market transaction is an Initial Public Offering (IPO), where a private
company offers its shares to the public for the first time.
Other examples include:
● Seasoned Equity Offerings (SEOs) – when public companies issue additional shares

● Bond Issuances – governments and corporations issue new bonds to finance operations
or projects
● Private Placements – securities are sold directly to a select group of investors (e.g.,
institutional investors) without going public
In the primary market:
● The issuer receives the proceeds from the sale
● The offering price is typically set with the help of investment banks
● Regulatory filings (like the SEC’s S-1 for IPOs) are required before the sale
Secondary Market
The secondary market is where existing securities are traded among investors after the initial
issuance. These transactions do not involve the issuing entity—the capital raised in the primary
market has already been received.
Key characteristics:
● Investors trade with each other, not with the company
● Provides liquidity, allowing investors to enter and exit positions
● Includes major exchanges (NYSE, Nasdaq), OTC markets, and electronic trading
platforms
In the secondary market:
● Prices fluctuate based on supply and demand, company fundamentals, macroeconomic
factors, and market sentiment
● Trading volumes, bid-ask spreads, and volatility all influence liquidity
Why Is It Important?
Understanding the distinction between primary and secondary markets is critical for investors
and financial analysts for several reasons:
● Capital Flow: In the primary market, proceeds benefit the issuer. In the secondary market,
proceeds go to the selling investor, not the company.
● Valuation Implications: IPOs and other primary offerings can dilute ownership and
influence market capitalization and valuation metrics.
● Liquidity: The secondary market ensures that securities are tradable, helping investors
maintain flexibility and manage risk.
● Price Discovery: The secondary market plays a key role in determining a security’s fair
market value through continuous trading.

● Investor Participation: Retail and institutional investors participate mostly in the
secondary market, while the primary market is often reserved for large investors or
institutions during the offering process.
How Is It Used in This Class?
In the Student Investment Fund course, students must understand and evaluate the impact of both
primary and secondary market dynamics on portfolio management:
● Initial Public Offerings (IPOs): Students analyze IPOs to assess valuation at issuance,
investor demand, underwriter influence, and potential alpha opportunities or
overvaluation risks.
● Dilution Risk: Students examine how secondary offerings and new issuances affect share
count, earnings per share (EPS), and overall ownership structure.
● Price Movement Analysis: Since most trades take place in the secondary market,
students learn to monitor stock price movements, trading volume, and liquidity to inform
entry and exit decisions.
● Liquidity Screens: Students incorporate secondary market liquidity (e.g., daily volume,
bid-ask spread) into their screening process to avoid illiquid securities.
Common vs. Preferred Stock
What Is It?
Equity securities are generally classified into two categories: common stock and preferred stock.
While both represent ownership in a corporation, they differ significantly in terms of rights,
income, risk, and position in the capital structure.
Common Stock
Common stock represents residual ownership in a corporation. Common shareholders are the last
in line in the event of liquidation, but they also hold the greatest potential for capital
appreciation. Key features include:
● Voting Rights: Common shareholders typically have the right to vote on corporate
matters, such as electing the board of directors or approving mergers. Some companies
may issue non-voting common stock, often to retain control among founders or insiders.
● Dividends: While dividends may be paid, they are not guaranteed and are declared at the
discretion of the board.
● Capital Appreciation: Shareholders benefit from increases in the stock price, often tied
to earnings growth, market sentiment, and economic conditions.
● Last in Liquidation: In a bankruptcy scenario, common shareholders are paid only after
all debts and preferred claims are satisfied.

Common stockholders bear more risk, but also enjoy the greatest upside potential.
Preferred Stock
Preferred stock is a hybrid security that combines features of both equity and fixed income
instruments. It generally pays a fixed dividend and has a higher claim on assets than common
stock, but typically lacks voting rights.
Key features include:
● Fixed Dividends: Preferred shareholders receive dividends at a fixed rate, often stated as
a percentage of par value. These dividends are paid before any dividends are distributed
to common shareholders.
● Priority in Liquidation: In the event of bankruptcy, preferred shareholders are paid
before common shareholders, but after debt holders.
● No Voting Rights: Preferred stockholders usually do not vote on corporate matters.
● Callable Features: Many preferred stocks are callable, meaning the issuer can redeem
them at a predetermined price after a certain date.
● Convertibility: Some preferred shares are convertible into common stock under specific
conditions.
Because of their fixed income-like characteristics, preferred stocks are often attractive to
income-focused investors seeking higher yields than bonds with slightly more risk.
Why Is It Important?
Understanding the distinction between common and preferred stock is essential for evaluating
capital structure, income potential, and risk exposure within a portfolio:

Different investor types are drawn to these securities based on their investment goals:
● Growth investors prefer common stock for its upside.
● Income investors prefer preferred stock for its steady payouts.
How Is It Used in This Class?
In the Student Investment Fund course, students use their understanding of common and
preferred stock to:
● Evaluate Capital Structure: Determine whether a company’s use of preferred stock
increases financial flexibility or adds unnecessary complexity or obligations.
● Build Equity Pitches: Decide whether to focus on common stock (typically) or avoid
companies with large amounts of outstanding preferred stock that may dilute upside or
burden the firm.
● Assess Risk Profiles: Analyze how preferred stock affects a company’s cost of capital,
interest coverage, and creditworthiness—important when investing in firms with
leveraged balance sheets.
● Compare Share Classes: Examine whether companies issue multiple classes of common
stock (e.g., Class A vs. Class B) and understand how these impact voting power and
governance risk.
Market Capitalization (Small, Mid, Large)
Market Capitalization (Small-Cap, Mid-Cap, Large-Cap)
What Is It?
Market capitalization (or market cap) refers to the total market value of a company’s outstanding
shares. It is a key metric used to assess a company’s size, and serves as a proxy for its maturity,
growth potential, and risk profile.
Formula:
Market Capitalization=Share Price×Number of Shares Outstanding
For example, if a company has 50 million shares outstanding and the current share price is $40:
Market Cap= 50,000,000×40=$2,000,000,000= $2 Billion
Market Cap Categories:
Though exact thresholds can vary slightly across institutions and index providers, the most
common classification is:

In some contexts, micro-cap (< $300 million) and mega-cap (> $200 billion) are also
considered.
Why Is It Important?
Market capitalization is more than just a number—it reflects where a company stands in its
lifecycle and has major implications for:
● Risk and Return Profile: Historically, small-cap stocks have offered higher returns but
with greater volatility, while large-cap stocks tend to offer lower but more stable returns.
● Investment Strategy: Asset managers often focus on certain cap ranges—e.g., small-cap
growth, large-cap value—due to differing risk-return characteristics.
● Liquidity: Large-cap stocks generally have more trading volume and narrower bid-ask
spreads, reducing transaction costs.
● Index Membership: Market cap determines inclusion in major indices like:
○ S&P 500 (large-cap)
○ S&P MidCap 400
○ Russell 2000 (small-cap)
● Institutional Attention: Large-cap companies receive more analyst coverage, while
small-caps are often underfollowed, offering potential alpha opportunities for active
managers.
How Is It Used in This Class?
Students in the Student Investment Fund use market capitalization as a foundational input for
both portfolio construction and security selection. Key applications include:
● Diversification Across Cap Sizes: Students build portfolios with exposure to various cap
ranges to balance risk and return.
● Performance Attribution: Cap size influences how stocks perform under different
economic conditions. For example:
○ Small-caps tend to outperform in early recovery phases of the business cycle.
○ Large-caps tend to be more resilient during economic downturns.

● Factor Investing: Students explore size as a systematic factor in equity returns (e.g., the
Fama-French SMB factor – “Small Minus Big”).
● Valuation and Risk Assessment: Understanding that small-cap firms may have less
predictable cash flows, higher cost of capital, and more idiosyncratic risk compared to
large-caps.
Types of Bonds
What Is It?
Bonds are debt securities issued by entities such as governments, municipalities, or corporations to raise
capital. When an investor buys a bond, they are effectively lending money to the issuer in exchange for
periodic interest payments (coupons) and the return of principal at maturity.
Bonds differ significantly in credit risk, tax treatment, duration, yield, and liquidity. Understanding the
various types of bonds is essential for constructing a diversified fixed income portfolio tailored to an
investor’s risk and return preferences.
Major Types of Bonds
Treasury Bonds (T-Bonds)
● Issuer: U.S. federal government (via the U.S. Department of the Treasury)
● Maturity: Long-term (typically 10 to 30 years)
● Risk Level: Considered risk-free for credit risk due to U.S. government backing
● Yield: Lower compared to other bonds of similar maturity
● Tax Treatment:
○ Exempt from state and local taxes
○ Subject to federal income tax
● Use Case: Capital preservation, benchmark rate for discounting cash flows, risk-free rate in
models (e.g., CAPM)
● Shorter-duration Treasury instruments include T-bills (under 1 year) and T-notes (1–10 years).
Municipal Bonds (Munis)
● Issuer: State and local governments or agencies
● Purpose: Fund public projects (schools, infrastructure, etc.)
● Risk Level: Varies by municipality; generally lower than corporates but higher than Treasuries
● Yield: Often lower before taxes, but may be higher after-tax due to tax exemption
● Tax Treatment:
○ Usually exempt from federal income tax
○ May also be exempt from state and local taxes if issued within the investor’s state of
residence
● Types:
○ General Obligation Bonds: Backed by full faith and credit of the issuer
○ Revenue Bonds: Backed by revenue from specific projects (e.g., toll roads)

Tax-Equivalent Yield Formula:
Tax-Equivalent Yield=Municipal Bond Yield1−Investor’s Marginal Tax Rate
Corporate Bonds
● Issuer: Public or private corporations
● Purpose: Raise capital for operations, M&A, debt refinancing, etc.
● Risk Level: Higher credit risk than government bonds
● Yield: Higher than Treasury and municipal bonds due to added risk
● Credit Ratings:
○ Investment Grade: BBB-/Baa3 or higher (e.g., Apple, Microsoft)
○ Non-Investment Grade (Junk): Below BBB-/Baa3
Junk Bonds (High-Yield Bonds)
● Issuer: Companies with lower credit ratings (often due to financial instability or high leverage)
● Yield: Very high to compensate for default risk
● Risk Level: Highest among bond types
● Suitability: Attractive for high-return seekers but inappropriate for conservative investors or
capital preservation.
Why Is It Important?
Each type of bond offers different risk-reward tradeoffs, making them crucial components in portfolio
diversification, income generation, and risk mitigation.
Knowing how to compare bond yields on a risk-adjusted and after-tax basis helps students make informed
decisions when evaluating fixed income investments.
How Is It Used in This Class?
Students in the Student Investment Fund course use their understanding of bond types to:
● Construct Income Strategies: Evaluate bonds as a source of stable cash flows, especially in lower-
return equity environments.

● Hedge Equity Exposure: Use high-quality bonds (like Treasuries) to reduce portfolio volatility
and preserve capital during market downturns.
● Perform Credit Analysis: Assess corporate bonds for default risk, interest coverage, and
creditworthiness.
● Analyze Yield Curves: Understand how different bond types react to interest rate movements and
economic conditions.
● Evaluate Tax Efficiency: Consider municipal bonds in taxable portfolios to enhance after-tax
returns for high-income investors.
Money Markets (CDs, T-Bills, etc.)
Money Markets (CDs, T-Bills, and Other Instruments)
What Is It?
The money market is a segment of the financial market where short-term debt instruments are
issued and traded. These instruments are characterized by high liquidity, low risk, and short
maturities—typically less than one year. Investors use the money market for cash management,
capital preservation, and short-term income generation.
Money market securities are often issued at a discount to face value, with the return realized at
maturity, and are primarily used by institutions, governments, and corporations for short-term
funding needs.
Key Money Market Instruments
Treasury Bills (T-Bills)
● Issuer: U.S. Department of the Treasury
● Maturities: Commonly 4, 13, 26, and 52 weeks
● Yield: Sold at a discount; no periodic interest. Yield is the difference between purchase
price and face value.
● Risk Level: Considered risk-free due to government backing
● Tax Treatment:
○ Exempt from state and local taxes
○ Subject to federal tax
T-Bill Yield Formula (Discount Basis):
Yield=(Face Value−Purchase Price Face Value) × (360Days to Maturity
Certificates of Deposit (CDs)
● Issuer: Commercial banks

● Definition: A time deposit where money is locked for a fixed term in exchange for a fixed
interest rate
● Maturities: Typically 3 months to 5 years; in the money market, terms are less than 1 year
● FDIC Insurance: Up to $250,000 per depositor, per bank
● Risk Level: Low for insured CDs
● Tradability: Non-negotiable CDs are held to maturity; negotiable CDs (over $100,000)
can be traded on the secondary market
Commercial Paper
● Issuer: Corporations with high credit ratings
● Purpose: Finance short-term liabilities like payroll, inventory
● Maturities: Usually 1 to 270 days
● Risk Level: Higher than T-Bills, but still low for top-rated firms
● Unsecured: No collateral; relies on issuer's creditworthiness
● Yield: Higher than T-Bills due to increased risk
Repurchase Agreements (Repos)
● Mechanism: One party sells a security and agrees to repurchase it at a higher price on a
specific date
● Function: Used for short-term borrowing, often overnight
● Collateralized: Typically backed by government securities
● Used By: Institutional investors, central banks, and large banks
Money Market Funds
● Definition: Mutual funds that invest in diversified portfolios of money market
instruments
● NAV Stability: Aim to maintain $1.00/share NAV (though not guaranteed)
● Use Case: Alternative to holding cash in brokerage or retirement accounts
Why Is It Important?
Money market instruments are essential for managing short-term liquidity and minimizing risk.
Their primary characteristics are:

Investors and portfolio managers rely on the money market during:
● Periods of uncertainty or market volatility
● Tactical asset allocation shifts
● Waiting periods before investing capital elsewhere
How Is It Used in This Class?
Students managing the Student Investment Fund are expected to apply money market principles
to real-world portfolio decisions:
● Cash Allocation: Determine how much of the $2 million portfolio should be held in cash
equivalents, especially during periods of high volatility or after realizing gains.
● Risk Management: Use T-Bills or money market funds as defensive positions to preserve
capital.
● Rebalancing Tool: Hold short-term instruments while evaluating longer-term equity or
fixed income opportunities.
● Yield Optimization: Choose higher-yielding money market options (e.g., commercial
paper, short-term CDs) over leaving cash uninvested.
By strategically using money market instruments, students practice liquidity management—a
core skill in institutional investing.
Market Participants and Their Roles
What Is It?

Participants in financial markets fall broadly into two categories: retail investors and institutional
investors. These groups differ in terms of capital size, trading behavior, access to information,
resources, and overall influence on the market.
Retail Investors
Definition:
Retail investors are individual, non-professional market participants who invest their own capital
through brokerage accounts, retirement plans (e.g., IRAs or 401(k)s), or trading platforms.
Characteristics:
● Capital Base: Typically small relative to institutions
● Trading Behavior: Often driven by sentiment, media narratives, social trends, or limited
financial analysis
● Time Horizon: Varies—can range from long-term (retirement planning) to short-term
(speculative day trading)
● Access to Research: Limited to public data and retail brokerage tools (e.g., Yahoo
Finance, Robinhood, E*TRADE)
● Investment Vehicles: Mutual funds, ETFs, stocks, options, cryptocurrencies
Examples:
● A college student investing $1,000 in tech stocks
● A retiree allocating savings into dividend-paying ETFs
Institutional Investors
Definition:
Institutional investors are professional managers of large capital pools. These entities include
pension funds, insurance companies, endowments, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds, and
mutual funds. They employ analysts, traders, and portfolio managers who follow disciplined,
research-driven investment processes.
Characteristics:
● Capital Base: Enormous—often managing hundreds of millions to trillions of dollars
● Trading Behavior: Data-driven, strategic, long-term focused or based on quantitative
models
● Time Horizon: Often long-term but may include short-term tactical positions (especially
hedge funds)

● Access to Research: Proprietary models, sell-side research, direct access to corporate
management, and institutional tools (e.g., Bloomberg Terminal, FactSet, Capital IQ)
● Market Impact: Their trades can move markets, and they often use block trades or dark
pools to minimize price impact
Examples:
● BlackRock, managing over $9 trillion in assets
● CalPERS (California Public Employees’ Retirement System)
● Bridgewater Associates (hedge fund)
Why Is It Important?
Understanding the distinction between retail and institutional investors is critical for analyzing
market behavior, pricing dynamics, and the flow of capital:
Retail investors can create volatility and momentum, especially during speculative surges (e.g.,
meme stocks), while institutional investors tend to anchor long-term valuations and play a
significant role in price discovery and capital allocation.
How Is It Used in This Class?
Students in the Student Investment Fund course examine the interaction between retail and
institutional investors to improve their own decision-making as they manage the portfolio.
Applications include:
● Analyzing Retail Behavior: Study retail investor flows using platforms like Robintrack,
Reddit (WallStreetBets), or FINRA data to assess sentiment and identify bubbles or
short-term opportunities.
● Understanding Volatility: Evaluate how retail speculation can create temporary
dislocations in price and how professionals might arbitrage or avoid them.

● Institutional Simulation: Students simulate institutional-style portfolio management,
using tools like Bloomberg and Capital IQ to conduct deep-dive equity research, perform
risk analysis, and justify long-term investment theses.
● Benchmarking Strategies: Compare institutional strategies (e.g., value investing, factor
models, macro overlays) with retail trading patterns and outcomes.
● ESG and Stewardship: Discuss how institutional investors influence corporate
governance and sustainability policies, while retail investors may lack such voting power
or engagement.

Market Makers & Liquidity Providers
What Is It?
Market makers and liquidity providers are essential participants in financial markets whose
primary role is to ensure continuous trading, reduce transaction costs, and enhance market
efficiency. They achieve this by continuously quoting bid and ask prices, allowing buyers and
sellers to transact even when natural counter-orders may not be immediately available.
Market Makers
A market maker is a firm or individual that stands ready to buy and sell a specific security on a
regular and continuous basis at publicly quoted prices.
How It Works:
● The bid price is the price at which the market maker will buy a security.
● The ask price (or offer price) is the price at which the market maker will sell the security.
● The spread (ask - bid) represents the market maker’s profit margin for providing
liquidity.
By posting both prices, market makers provide a two-sided market, enabling efficient and
immediate transactions.
Obligations (Depending on the exchange):
● Maintain minimum quote sizes
● Provide continuous liquidity
● Stay within specified spread limits
Examples of registered market makers include:
● Citadel Securities
● Virtu Financial
● Jane Street
Liquidity Providers
While market makers are often regulated entities with quoting obligations, liquidity providers
may include high-frequency trading (HFT) firms, hedge funds, and institutional traders who
voluntarily offer liquidity by entering limit orders into the market.
● May not be obligated to provide quotes but profit from spread capture, arbitrage, or
rebates offered by exchanges.

● Often use algorithmic trading strategies to identify short-term mispricings or volume
imbalances.
● Play a critical role during times of high volatility when natural buyers and sellers may
withdraw.
Why Is It Important?
Market makers and liquidity providers play a foundational role in ensuring market functionality,
especially in markets with low trading volume or high volatility.
How Is It Used in This Class?
In the Student Investment Fund understanding the role of market makers and liquidity providers
is key to analyzing execution quality, price efficiency, and portfolio liquidity:
● Bid-Ask Spread Awareness: Students assess the impact of spreads on total transaction
cost, especially in thinly traded small-cap stocks.
● Liquidity Screens: Before investing, students evaluate average daily volume, order book
depth, and spread size to determine whether a position is realistically executable without
significant price movement.
● Risk Assessment: In market downturns, liquidity providers may withdraw, creating
liquidity risk—students incorporate this into risk-adjusted return analysis.

Regulatory Bodies
What Is It?
Financial markets operate under the oversight of regulatory bodies tasked with maintaining fair,
transparent, and efficient capital markets. These institutions enforce rules, protect investors, and
promote confidence in the financial system. In the United States, three of the most prominent
regulatory bodies are:
1. SEC – Securities and Exchange Commission
2. FINRA – Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
3. CFTC – Commodity Futures Trading Commission
SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission)
Definition:
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is an independent federal agency
established in 1934 under the Securities Exchange Act. It enforces securities laws and regulates
the capital markets, including public companies, investment advisors, mutual funds, and
exchanges.
Key Functions:
● Mandating public disclosure via forms such as 10-K (annual), 10-Q (quarterly), and 8-K
(material events)
● Enforcing laws against insider trading, fraud, and market manipulation
● Approving and monitoring IPOs and other securities offerings
● Overseeing exchanges like the NYSE and Nasdaq
● Licensing and inspecting investment advisors and mutual funds
Importance:
The SEC’s role is vital in ensuring market integrity, investor protection, and equal access to
information. By mandating standardized disclosures, the SEC helps investors make informed
decisions and maintains public confidence in U.S. markets.
How It’s Used in This Course:
● Students analyze company fundamentals using SEC filings like 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and DEF
14A (proxy statements) to assess strategy, financial health, and risks.
● SEC data serves as a primary source for earnings reports, management discussion &
analysis (MD&A), segment breakdowns, and shareholding structures.

● Students study regulatory compliance, especially when evaluating IPOs, capital raises, or
governance concerns.
FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority)
Definition:
FINRA is a self-regulatory organization (SRO) under SEC supervision. It oversees broker-
dealers, registered representatives, and investment firms, enforcing ethical standards and
professional conduct within the securities industry.
Key Functions:
● Licensing and registration of brokers via Series exams (e.g., Series 7, Series 63)
● Conducting audits and investigations into improper sales practices
● Enforcing disclosure requirements (e.g., conflicts of interest, suitability)
● Educating investors and promoting transparency through public databases like
BrokerCheck
● Arbitrating disputes between investors and brokers
Importance:
FINRA plays a crucial role in maintaining investor trust, especially in the retail investing space.
Its enforcement of conduct standards ensures that investors receive fair treatment and that
advisors act in the client’s best interest.
How It’s Used in This Course:
● In discussions on wealth management, mutual funds, and ETFs, students explore how
FINRA regulations affect investment product disclosures.
● Students consider FINRA rules when simulating roles such as financial advisors or
portfolio managers, particularly in discussions of compliance and fiduciary duty.
CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission)
Definition:
The CFTC is an independent U.S. government agency created in 1974 to regulate the derivatives
markets, including futures, options, and swaps. It focuses on systemic risk reduction, market
transparency, and consumer protection.
Key Functions:
● Oversight of derivatives markets, including commodities, financial futures, and swaps

● Monitoring speculative activity in commodity markets (e.g., oil, wheat, interest rate
swaps)
● Enforcing rules against market manipulation and fraud
● Registering and supervising futures commission merchants (FCMs), swap dealers, and
commodity pool operators
● Coordinating with other global regulators to manage cross-border risk
Importance:
The CFTC ensures that complex derivatives markets do not pose systemic risks or harm
investors. Its oversight helps prevent financial crises, such as the misuse of credit default swaps
in 2008, and preserves market confidence.
How It’s Used in This Course:
● Students explore futures and options for hedging or speculative purposes, and understand
the regulatory framework ensuring these instruments are used responsibly.
● In portfolio simulations, students may allocate to commodity-linked ETFs or futures, and
must consider margin requirements, position limits, and CFTC rules.
● Students analyze risk management strategies, such as using interest rate futures to hedge
bond exposure or commodity futures to reduce input cost volatility.

Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)
What Is It?
The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is a foundational theory in financial economics stating
that security prices fully reflect all available information at any given time. Proposed by Eugene
Fama in the 1970s, EMH implies that markets are so informationally efficient that no investor
can consistently achieve excess returns (i.e., alpha) through market timing or security selection,
once risk is accounted for.
At its core, EMH challenges the premise of consistently profitable active management and
emphasizes the difficulty of "beating the market" without inside information or luck.
Why Is It Important?
Understanding EMH is essential because it:
● Frames the debate between active and passive investing.
● Informs how investors allocate capital, interpret signals, and build portfolios.
● Highlights the role of information dissemination, investor behavior, and institutional
constraints in pricing.
● Sets the groundwork for modern portfolio theory, index fund investing, and behavioral
finance critiques.
If EMH holds, especially in its stronger forms, then investors should favor low-cost, passive
strategies, as active strategies cannot systematically outperform after fees and taxes.
EMH is categorized into three forms based on the type of information believed to be reflected in
asset prices:
Weak Form Efficiency
Definition:
Under weak form efficiency, current security prices fully incorporate all historical market data,
including past prices, returns, and trading volume.
Implications:
● Technical analysis (i.e., charting patterns or momentum strategies) cannot generate
consistent excess returns.
● Random walk theory: Price changes are unpredictable and follow a random path.
Application in This Course:

● Students may choose to test price patterns (e.g., moving averages, breakout strategies) to
evaluate whether past performance can predict future returns.
● Students may also look to apply statistical tools like autocorrelation tests and time-series
regressions on historical price data.
Semi-Strong Form Efficiency
Definition:
In the semi-strong form, prices instantly and fully reflect all publicly available information,
including earnings announcements, economic data, financial statements, analyst reports, and
news events.
Implications:
● Fundamental analysis is unlikely to consistently outperform the market, as the
information it relies on is already priced in.
● Market reactions to news should be immediate and complete, leaving little room for post-
event alpha.
Application in This Course:
● Assumed as the base case for evaluating market behavior.
● Students conduct event studies (e.g., earnings surprises, M&A announcements) to assess
how rapidly and efficiently markets incorporate new information.
● Learn to differentiate between expected vs. unexpected components of news (e.g.,
earnings "beats") and assess market reaction.
Strong Form Efficiency
Definition:
The strong form asserts that prices incorporate all information, both public and private (insider
information).
Implications:
● No investor, including corporate insiders or hedge fund managers, can consistently
achieve abnormal returns.
● Raises critical ethical and legal concerns regarding insider trading and unequal access to
material information.
Application in This Course:
● Discussed in the context of ethics and regulation.

● Students review insider trading laws, Reg FD (Fair Disclosure), and the implications of
information asymmetry in capital markets.
● Understand why strong form efficiency is not assumed in practice due to the presence of
information-based trading advantages.
Critiques and Limitations
While EMH remains influential, it has been challenged by behavioral finance and empirical
anomalies such as:
● Momentum and reversal effects
● Calendar effects (e.g., January effect)
● Investor overreaction or underreaction
● Bubbles and crashes (e.g., Dot-com, Housing Crisis)
These critiques highlight that markets are not perfectly efficient and that investor psychology,
institutional frictions, and information delays can create temporary inefficiencies—areas where
skilled investors may still find opportunity.

Role of Market Sentiment & Behavioral Biases
What Is It?
While traditional finance assumes that investors are rational and markets are efficient, behavioral
finance recognizes that psychological biases and emotions influence investor behavior, often
leading to mispricings, volatility, and opportunities for excess return.
Market sentiment refers to the overall attitude of investors toward a particular market or asset,
often driven by emotion rather than fundamentals. Sentiment can amplify price swings and lead
to herd behavior, especially during periods of euphoria or panic.
Behavioral biases are systematic patterns of deviation from rationality that affect judgment and
decision-making. Understanding these biases is essential for identifying trading opportunities,
avoiding cognitive traps, and improving investment discipline.
Overreaction
Definition:
Overreaction occurs when investors respond to news—particularly surprises—with excessive
enthusiasm or pessimism, causing stock prices to deviate temporarily from intrinsic value.
Examples:
● A company slightly misses earnings estimates, and its stock drops 15% despite strong
fundamentals.
● A stock surges on positive but marginal news (e.g., minor product upgrade or vague
M&A rumor).
Why It Matters:
● Creates short-term mispricings that often revert to mean.
● Provides alpha opportunities for contrarian investors who can identify unjustified price
moves.
Use in This Course:
● Students analyze earnings reactions, post-news price drift, and price reversals to identify
short-term opportunities driven by emotional overreaction.
● Event studies help determine if prices correct following extreme one-day movements.
Confirmation Bias
Definition:

Confirmation bias is the tendency to favor information that supports existing beliefs and ignore
or downplay contradictory evidence.
Examples:
● An investor bullish on a stock only reads favorable analyst reports and disregards
warnings in SEC filings.
● A team pitching a company ignores competitive threats or slowing revenue growth.
Why It Matters:
● Leads to overconfidence, biased valuation models, and groupthink.
● Undermines objectivity and can result in flawed investment decisions.
Use in This Course:
● Students are trained to challenge investment theses by seeking out counterarguments,
bearish cases, and stress-testing assumptions.
● Peer feedback during pitch reviews helps expose blind spots and cognitive traps.
● Encourages intellectual humility and a balanced research process.
Anchoring
Definition:
Anchoring refers to the cognitive bias of over-relying on an initial piece of information, such as a
prior stock price, valuation multiple, or analyst forecast, even when more relevant or updated
data is available.
Examples:
● Valuing a stock based on its previous 52-week high instead of current fundamentals.
● Using a company’s historical P/E ratio as a valuation benchmark despite a major shift in
its business model.
Why It Matters:
● Can distort valuation models, hinder objective analysis, and delay decision-making.
● Investors may hold onto losing positions, expecting a return to an arbitrary price anchor.
Use in This Course:
● Students are encouraged to rebuild models when new information becomes available
rather than anchoring to earlier estimates.

● Emphasis on dynamic valuation—adjusting assumptions for changing macroeconomic,
competitive, or financial conditions.

Equity Analysis & Valuation
Fundamental vs. Technical vs. Systematic Analysis
What it is:
Equity analysis refers to the process of evaluating stocks to determine their intrinsic value and
potential for investment. It is typically categorized into three primary approaches:
● Fundamental Analysis: Fundamental analysis is a method of evaluating a stock’s intrinsic
value by examining related economic, financial, and qualitative factors. This approach
involves analyzing financial statements, industry conditions, macroeconomic indicators,
and company-specific factors such as management quality and competitive positioning.
● Technical Analysis: Technical analysis is the study of past price movements and volume
data to forecast future price trends. Unlike fundamental analysis, which focuses on
intrinsic value, technical analysis is purely based on market price action and investor
sentiment.
● Systematic Analysis: Systematic analysis, also known as quantitative investing, relies on
data-driven models, algorithms, and factor-based strategies to make investment decisions.
Unlike discretionary investing, which depends on human judgment, systematic investing
removes emotional biases and ensures a rules-based approach.
Why it’s important:
● Fundamental Analysis Fundamental analysis helps investors determine whether a stock is
overvalued or undervalued by looking at its true worth rather than just its market price.
Long-term investors, such as Warren Buffett and value investors, rely heavily on this
approach to make informed investment decisions.
● Technical Analysis Technical analysis is widely used by traders, hedge funds, and high-
frequency trading firms to make short-term trading decisions. It helps in identifying
trends, support/resistance levels, and momentum-based trading opportunities.
● Systematic Analysis reduces human bias by relying on statistical methods and machine
learning. Also allows investors to evaluate strategies before implementing them through
the use of back testing.
How are the three approaches used in this class?
This class will focus on fundamental valuation techniques such as DCF, Comps, and Precedent
Transactions, as well as systematic investing strategies for portfolio construction and risk
assessment. Over the course of the year, students will work in investment teams to pitch their
own fundamental and systematic investments to aid in the SIF Portfolio. Technical Analysis is a
less used approach but may aid in the context of momentum investing or market timing
strategies.

Financial Statement Analysis
Financial statement analysis involves evaluating a company's financial health using three key
statements: the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement.
Income Statement
What it is:
The income statement (also called the Profit & Loss statement, or P&L) summarizes a company's
revenues, expenses, and profits over a specific period (e.g., quarterly or annually). It shows how
much revenue a company generates and how efficiently it converts that revenue into profit.
Why it’s important:
It provides insights into operational performance, cost efficiency, and profitability. Investors and
analysts use it to determine trends in revenue, profit margins, and earnings. It is also used to
calculate important financial metrics such as EPS, margins, and profitability ratios. These
financial metrics provide investors and analysts with information to determine a company’s
ability to generate profits and sustain growth.
Key Components:
● Revenue: The total income generated from sales before expenses. This is often referred
to as the “Top Line” and is recorded when a sale is made, not necessarily when cash is
received (accrual accounting)
○ Formula: Revenue = Sales Price × Quantity Sold
● Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): The direct costs of producing the goods or services sold
by a company. Generally includes materials, labor and manufacturing expenses.
● Gross Profit: Represents the profit after subtracting direct production costs. Indicates a
company’s ability to manage production costs effectively before taking other expenses
into consideration.
○ Formula: Gross Profit = Revenue – COGS
● Operating Expenses (SG&A): Includes operating expenses such as salaries, rent,
utilities, and marketing while excluding financing costs and tax expenses.
● Operating Income (EBIT): Earnings before interest and taxes, showing core business
profitability before considering financing and taxes. Often used as a key indicator of
operational efficiency.
○ Formula: EBIT = Revenue - COGS - Operating Expenses
● Interest & Taxes: Often includes interest expense, interest income, and taxes owed.
Interest expense is the cost of borrowing money, interest income is income earned from
lent money, and taxes are federal, state, etc. taxes that must be paid by the corporation.

● Net Income: The company’s final profit after all expenses, taxes, and interest. This is
often referred to as a company’s “Bottom Line” and the number is used to calculate EPS.
○ Formula: Net Income = Revenue - Total Expenses
○ Formula: Net Income=EBIT - Interest Expense - Taxes
○ EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):
A measure of core operational performance excluding non-cash charges.
Commonly used to compare profitability across companies with different capital
structures. Ignores non-cash charges being depreciation and amortization and
financing costs.
○ Formula: EBITDA = EBIT + Depreciation + Amortization
● EPS (Earnings Per Share): The profit available to each outstanding share. Can be
expressed as basic or diluted. Diluted includes all shares that are available to be
converted into common stock such as employee stock option. Diluted is a more
conservative measure of EPS while Basic reflects the current shares held.
○ Formula: Basic EPS = Net Income / Number of Basic Shares Outstanding
○ Formula: Diluted EPS = Net Income / Number of Diluted Shares Outstanding
Key Margins:
● Gross Margin: Measures profitability after direct costs.
○ Formula: Gross Margin = (Gross Profit / Revenue) × 100
● Operating Margin: Indicates profitability after operating costs.
○ Formula: Operating Margin = (EBIT / Revenue) × 100
● Net Margin: Shows overall profitability.
○ Formula: Net Margin = (Net Income / Revenue) × 100
Balance Sheet
What it is:
The balance sheet provides a snapshot of a company’s financial position at a specific moment in
time. It consists of assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity, following the fundamental
equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity. One interesting component of the balance sheet is that it
is organized based upon liquidity with most liquid items coming first (Cash & Cash Equivalents)
and the least liquid items coming last (Long Term Liabilities).
Why it’s important:
Shows what a company owns (assets) and what it owes (liabilities). It helps investors assess a
company's liquidity, leverage, and overall financial stability. Used for calculating important
ratios like current ratio, debt-to-equity, return on equity (ROE), and return on assets (ROA).
Key Components:

● Assets: What the company owns
○ Cash & Cash Equivalents: most liquid assets
○ Accounts Receivable (A/R): money owed by customers
○ Inventory: product available for sale
○ Short-Term Investments: Marketable securities
○ PP&E: Factories, land and equipment.
○ Intangible Assets: Patents, trademarks, and goodwill
○ Long- Term Investments: Investments held for strategic purposes.
● Liabilities: The company’s financial obligations
○ Accounts Payable (A/P): money owed to suppliers or partners
○ Short-term debt: Loans due within a year
○ Accrued Expenses: Wages, taxes and other obligations
○ Long-term debt: Bonds and loans maturing after a year
○ Deferred Tax Liabilities: Taxes owed in future years
● Equity: The net worth of the company (assets - liabilities).
○ Common Stock & APIC: Initial money invested by shareholders
○ Retained Earnings: Profits kept by the company instead of paying out as
dividends
○ Treasury Stock: Shares repurchased by the company
Key Ratios:
● Current Ratio: Measures short-term liquidity.
○ Formula: Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
● Quick Ratio: A more conservative liquidity measure.
○ Formula: Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
● Debt-to-Equity Ratio: Indicates leverage.
○ Formula: Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Equity
Cash Flow Statement
What it is:
The cash flow statement shows actual cash moving in and out of a business, categorized into
operating, investing, and financing activities.
Why it’s important:
Cash flow is a better indicator of financial health than net income. Companies can be profitable
but still run out of cash if they have very high receivables or debt payments. Investors prefer
companies with strong free cash flow (FCF).
Key Sections:

● Operating Activities: Cash flows from core business operations. Measures how much
cash a company generates from daily operations. Add back non-cash expenses
(depreciation and amortization) and Adjust for changes in working capital (inventory,
A/R, A/P)
○ Operating Cash Flow=Net Income+Depreciation+Working Capital Adjustments
● Investing Activities: Cash spent on or received from asset purchases and investments.
Negative investing cash flow usually means a company is expanding.
● Financing Activities: Cash inflows/outflows from debt issuance, dividends, and stock
repurchases.
FCF (Free Cash Flow) & Its Importance
What it is:
Free Cash Flow represents the cash a company generates after accounting for capital
expenditures (CapEx).
Why it’s important:
● Determines a company’s ability to fund operations, pay dividends, and expand.
● Used in valuation models like DCF.
Formula:
● FCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures
Difference Between Earnings and Cash Flow
● Earnings (Net Income) includes non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization.
● Cash Flow reflects actual cash movements, offering a more reliable indicator of financial
health.
Key Financial Ratios
Profitability Ratios
● Return on Assets (ROA) = Net Income / Total Assets
● Return on Equity (ROE) = Net Income / Shareholders’ Equity
Liquidity Ratios
● Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
● Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
Solvency Ratios

● Debt-to-Equity = Total Debt / Total Equity
● Interest Coverage = EBIT / Interest Expense
Efficiency Ratios
● Asset Turnover = Revenue / Total Assets
● Inventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory
Valuation Ratios
● P/E Ratio = Stock Price / EPS
● EV/EBITDA = Enterprise Value / EBITDA
How is it used in this class?
These ratios will be used in equity screening for either a fundamental pitch or systematic
pitch. The ratio provides detailed information into the health and efficiency of a company.
The ratios may be used during your fundamental analysis. They are also commonly used in
equity screening to filter for companies with certain criteria. Equity screening may be used to
find a company for your fundamental pitch or as a screening to filter based upon your
systematic strategy. Bloomberg terminal is a common resource for equity screening. Type
EQS (Equity Screening) into the Bloomberg search bar and it will take you to a screen to
filter companies by financial ratios.
Porter’s 5 Forces
What it is:
Porter’s 5 Forces is a framework developed by Michael Porter that analyzes the competitive
forces within an industry. It helps determine the attractiveness and profitability of a market by
assessing the external pressures that affect a company's ability to generate returns.
Why it’s important:
This model is essential for understanding the competitive dynamics within an industry. It helps
companies identify potential threats, assess their market position, and develop strategies to
enhance their competitive edge.
Forces:
1. Threat of New Entrants –Referring to the risk that new companies may enter the
industry and disrupt market share and pricing.
Key Factors: High capital requirements, economies of scale, brand loyalty, access to
distribution channels, government regulations.

2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers – The power suppliers have to drive up prices or reduce
the quality of goods and services.
Key Factors: Number of suppliers, switching costs, importance of input, etc.
3. Bargaining Power of Buyers – The ability of customers to influence prices and demand
better quality or services.
Key Factors: Number of buyers, price sensitivity, availability of substitutes.
4. Threat of Substitutes – The risk that customers may switch to alternative products or
services.
Key Factors: Substitute availability, cost of switching, perceived quality.
5. Industry Rivalry – The intensity of competition among existing competitors.
Key Factors: Number of competitors, market growth rate, product differentiation, and
fixed costs.
SWOT Analysis
What it is:
SWOT Analysis is a strategic tool used to evaluate a company’s internal strengths and
weaknesses, as well as external opportunities and threats. It provides a comprehensive overview
of the factors that can affect an organization’s success.
Why it’s important:
SWOT Analysis helps businesses craft effective strategies by leveraging their strengths,
addressing weaknesses, exploiting opportunities, and mitigating threats. It serves as a foundation
for strategic planning, risk management, and competitive positioning.
1. Strengths (Internal Positive Factors): Characteristics that give a company a
competitive edge.
○ Strong brand recognition (e.g., Apple, Coca-Cola).
○ Proprietary technology or patents.
○ Efficient supply chain management.
○ Skilled workforce and strong corporate culture.
○ Why it matters: Strengths help a company capitalize on opportunities and fend
off competition.
2. Weaknesses (Internal Negative Factors): Internal limitations that hinder a company’s
performance.

○ High production costs.
○ Poor financial health or high debt.
○ Limited product range or weak brand presence.
○ Inefficient processes or outdated technology.
○ Why it matters: Identifying weaknesses allows companies to improve operations
and reduce vulnerabilities.
3. Opportunities (External Positive Factors): External factors that a company can exploit
for growth and success.
○ Emerging markets and new customer segments.
○ Technological advancements.
○ Regulatory changes favoring the industry.
○ Strategic partnerships or acquisitions.
○ Why it matters: Opportunities provide avenues for expansion, innovation, and
increased revenue.
4. Threats (External Negative Factors): External challenges that could negatively impact
a company.
○ Intense competition and price wars.
○ Economic downturns or market volatility.
○ Changes in consumer preferences.
○ Supply chain disruptions or regulatory hurdles.
○ Why it matters: Recognizing threats helps companies prepare contingency plans
and mitigate risks.
How Porter’s 5 Forces and SWOT Analysis are Used in This Class:
● Porter’s 5 Forces: Applied in industry analysis to assess market attractiveness,
competitive pressures, and strategic positioning.
● SWOT Analysis: Used to evaluate companies, guide strategic decision-making, and
develop competitive strategies.
Together, these frameworks provide a comprehensive approach to analyzing industries and
companies, essential for fundamental investment pitches and equity analysis.
Time Value Money (TVM)
What it is:
The Time Value of Money (TVM) is the concept that money available now is worth more than
the same amount in the future because of its potential earning capacity. In other words, a dollar
today can be invested to earn interest, making it more valuable than a dollar received tomorrow.
Why it’s important:

Time Value of Money (TVM) is a fundamental concept in finance, crucial for comparing
investment opportunities and calculating the present and future values of cash flows. It is
essential for valuing assets such as stocks, bonds, and loans, and forms the basis for advanced
financial techniques like Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and
Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) models..;;l;

Perpeturnity
A perpetuity is a series of equal payments made at regular intervals that continue forever.
Unlike annuities, which have an end date, perpetuities assume the cash flows never stop.
Perpetuities are commonly used in finance to value preferred stock, perpetual bonds, and
trusts—and are especially useful when valuing stocks that pay constant dividends indefinitely.
Formula
𝑃𝑉 𝑜𝑓 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑝𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦 = 
𝑃𝑀𝑇
𝑟
The formula assumes payments go on forever and start at the end of the first period (ordinary
perpetuity).
Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation
What it is:
DCF valuation estimates the intrinsic value of a company based on its future cash flows, which
are discounted back to their present value using a required rate of return.
Why it’s important:
DCF provides a comprehensive valuation by considering the time value of money and expected
future performance, essential for investment decisions.
Process Steps:
1. Forecast Free Cash Flows (FCF): Estimate cash flows the company is expected to
generate.
○ Use historical data and assumptions about revenue growth, operating expenses,
capital expenditures, and working capital.
2. Determine the Discount Rate (WACC): Calculate the company’s Weighted Average Cost
of Capital.
○ WACC = (E/V * Re) + (D/V * Rd * (1 - Tc))
○ E = Equity, D = Debt, V = Total value, Re = Cost of equity, Rd = Cost of debt, Tc
= Tax rate.
3. Calculate Terminal Value: Estimate the value beyond the forecast period.
○ Gordon Growth Model: TV = FCFₙ × (1 + g) / (r - g)
○ Exit Multiple Method: TV = EBITDAₙ × Multiple.

4. Discount Cash Flows to Present Value: Apply the discount rate to each year’s FCF and
terminal value.
5. Sum and Adjust: Add all discounted cash flows and subtract net debt to find the equity
value.
Comparable Company Analysis (Comps)
What it is:
Comps valuation involves comparing a company’s valuation metrics with similar publicly traded
companies.
Why it’s important:
Provides a market-based valuation and is easy to understand, commonly used in investment
banking.
Process Steps:
1. Select Peer Group: Choose companies in the same industry with similar size, growth and
preferably operating region.
2. Select Multiples: Use P/E, EV/EBITDA, P/B, EV/Revenue.
3. Calculate Multiples for Peers: Find average or median multiples.
4. Apply Multiples to Target: Multiply the target company’s metrics by the chosen
multiples.
Precedent Transactions Analysis
What it is:
Valuation based on prices paid in similar M&A transactions.
Why it’s important:
Reflects market conditions and control premiums.
Process Steps:
1. Identify Relevant Transactions: Similar industry, size, geography.
2. Analyze Deal Terms: Price paid, payment method.
3. Calculate Transaction Multiples: EV/EBITDA, P/E.
4. Apply Multiples to Target: Estimate value based on historical deals.

Investment Strategies
What Is It?
An investment strategy is a systematic plan designed to help investors achieve their financial objectives
by identifying and allocating capital to specific types of securities. Strategies often reflect an investor’s
risk tolerance, return expectations, time horizon, and philosophy of market behavior.
Three of the most widely used equity strategies are:
● Growth Investing
● Value Investing
● Momentum Investing
Each strategy is grounded in distinct assumptions about how markets price securities and what drives
alpha generation.
Growth Investing
Definition:
Growth investing focuses on companies expected to grow revenues, earnings, and cash flows faster than
their industry peers or the broader market. These firms are typically innovators or disruptors with
significant scalability and reinvestment potential.
Why It’s Important:
● Growth stocks have historically delivered strong long-term capital appreciation.
● Aligned with innovation cycles and macroeconomic expansion.
● Attracts investors with a longer time horizon and higher risk tolerance.
Process:
Key Metrics:

● Revenue growth (% YoY)
● Earnings per share (EPS) growth
● ROE, ROIC
● Forward P/E or PEG ratio (P/E ÷ growth rate)
Risks:
● High valuations can lead to sharp corrections if growth disappoints.
● Greater sensitivity to interest rate increases (due to long-duration cash flows).
● Growth expectations may already be priced in.
Use in This Course:
● Students identify high-growth companies in sectors like technology, healthcare, or consumer
discretionary.
● Build DCF models with optimistic top-line projections and reinvestment assumptions.
● Evaluate price-to-growth metrics and industry TAM (Total Addressable Market).
Value Investing
Definition:
Value investing involves buying securities believed to be undervalued relative to their intrinsic value.
These stocks typically trade at a discount to their fundamentals, offering a margin of safety and the
potential for price correction.
Why It’s Important:
● Exploits inefficiencies in pricing due to market pessimism or neglect.
● Historically shown to outperform during market recoveries and rising rate environments.
● Focuses on downside protection and absolute return.
Process:

Key Metrics:
● P/E ratio
● Price-to-book (P/B)
● EV/EBITDA
● Free cash flow yield
● Dividend coverage ratio
Risks:
● Value traps: Stocks may be cheap for good reason and never rebound.
● Catalyst risk: Mispricing can persist without a triggering event.
● Underperformance during momentum-driven bull markets.
Use in This Course:
● Students build screens to identify undervalued but fundamentally sound companies.
● Compare market-implied valuations vs. intrinsic valuations.
● Apply value investing to cyclical industries or turnaround stories.
Momentum Investing
Definition:
Momentum investing is a strategy that buys securities exhibiting strong recent performance and sells
those with weak performance, based on the principle that winners tend to keep winning—at least for a
period.
Why It’s Important:
● Exploits behavioral biases like investor herding and underreaction to news.
● Backed by empirical research as a persistently strong anomaly.
● Allows investors to ride trends rather than forecast fundamentals.
Process:

Key Metrics:
● 6-month and 12-month total return
● Relative Strength Index (RSI)
● Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
● Sharpe ratio or Information ratio (for risk-adjusted momentum)
Risks:
● Trend reversals can lead to sharp drawdowns.
● Overcrowded trades may unwind quickly.
● Higher turnover and transaction costs.
Use in This Course:
● Students build momentum screens and test strategies using backtesting tools.
● Combine momentum with other factors (e.g., size, volatility) in multi-factor models.
● Assess entry/exit signals and trade timing, especially during earnings season or sector rotations.

Portfolio Management & Asset Allocation
Cumulative Return
Cumulative Return
What Is It?
A cumulative return on an investment is the aggregate amount that the investment has gained or
lost over time, independent of the amount of time involved. The cumulative return is expressed
as a percentage, and it is the raw mathematical return of the following calculation:
𝐶𝑢𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛 = 
(𝐶𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑆𝑒𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦) − (𝑂𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑆𝑒𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦)
𝑂𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑆𝑒𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦
Why Is It Important?
Cumulative return is a key metric for evaluating investment performance over time:
● Provides a simple, intuitive snapshot of total gain or loss.
● Useful for comparing different investments over the same or different time horizons.
● Commonly used in reporting fund performance (e.g., 1-year, 5-year, since inception).
● Helps investors evaluate the impact of staying invested over time.
● Can highlight the compounding effects of reinvested earnings.
Formula
𝐶𝑢𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛 = 
(𝐶𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑆𝑒𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦) − (𝑂𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑆𝑒𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦)
𝑂𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑆𝑒𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦
Example
If you invest $1,000 and the value grows to $1,300, your cumulative return is:
𝐶𝑢𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛 = 
($𝟏, 𝟑𝟎𝟎, ) − ($𝟏, 𝟑𝟎𝟎, )
$𝟏, 𝟑𝟎𝟎
𝐶𝑢𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛 = 30%
Expected Return
What Is It?

Expected return is the estimate of the average return an investor anticipates earning from an
investment over a future period. There are two parts to calculating the expected return of a
portfolio. Firstly, it is calculated using the weighted average of all possible returns. Theneach
potential outcome is weighted by its respective probability of occurrence.
Expected return is a forward-looking metric and does not guarantee actual performance. Rather,
it represents a rational expectation based on available information and assigned probabilities.
Why Is It Important?
Expected return is fundamental to a wide array of financial theories and practical applications:
● Serves as a benchmark for evaluating the attractiveness of a single asset or an entire
portfolio
● Used in asset pricing models, such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
● Helps in capital allocation decisions, risk budgeting, and scenario analysis
● Allows for comparison of investment opportunities with differing risk profiles
Central to mean-variance optimization in modern portfolio theory
Formula
𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛 = (𝑊1 ∗ 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏2) + (𝑤1 ∗ 𝑊2
This formula is used when you have a discrete set of outcomes with assigned probabilities.
Example:
So, the expected return is 5.25%.
Alternative Form (Portfolio Context):
When estimating the expected return of a portfolio based on individual asset weights:

This form is widely used in portfolio construction and optimization.
How Is It Used in This Course?
Students apply expected return calculations in multiple contexts:
● Portfolio Construction: Combine multiple assets and calculate the expected return of the
full portfolio based on asset weights and projected returns.
● Capital Budgeting and Valuation: Use expected return as a discount rate to evaluate
future cash flows in DCF models or scenario-based projects.
● Risk/Return Tradeoff: Compare expected return with standard deviation or beta to
evaluate risk-adjusted performance.
● Scenario Analysis: Assign probabilities to different economic conditions and model how
portfolio or individual securities may perform.
Variance
What Is It?
Variance is a statistical measure that quantifies the dispersion of returns around their mean. In investing, it
reflects how much the returns of an asset or portfolio fluctuate over time. A higher variance indicates that
returns are more spread out, implying greater uncertainty and risk, while a lower variance suggests more
consistent performance.
Variance is one of the foundational metrics in risk management and modern portfolio theory.
Why Is It Important?
● Measures volatility, a key component of investment risk.
● Forms the basis for related risk metrics like standard deviation, beta, and Sharpe ratio.
● Allows investors to compare the riskiness of different assets or portfolios.
● Crucial input in portfolio optimization models, particularly mean-variance optimization.
● Enables a better understanding of return variability in both individual securities and diversified
portfolios.

In financial decision-making, variance is not inherently "bad," but it is important because more variance
means more unpredictability, which must be compensated for by higher expected returns.
This is the sample variance formula, used when analyzing historical return data.
Step-by-Step Calculation Example:
Assume the following monthly returns for a stock:

So, variance = 5.0625 (squared %)
Standard Deviation vs. Variance
To make variance more interpretable (since it is in squared units), we take its square root:
This gives us the standard deviation, which is more commonly used in practice but built directly on
variance.
How Is It Used in This Course?
Students in the Student Investment Fund use variance in a number of practical applications:
● Quantifying Portfolio Risk: Variance is calculated for both individual securities and the overall
portfolio to measure total volatility.
● Sharpe Ratio Calculation:
Where stddev is derived from variance.
● Backtesting Strategies: Variance is used to evaluate the stability of historical returns.
● Comparing Investments: Analyze whether a stock’s high return compensates for its high variance.
Portfolio Variance Extension
When building portfolios, variance becomes more complex due to inter-asset correlations:
This is central to modern portfolio theory, where the goal is to construct a portfolio that minimizes
variance for a given expected return.
Tools and Data Sources

● Excel / Google Sheets: Use VAR.S() for sample variance or calculate manually
● Python / Pandas: .var() function
● Bloomberg Terminal: Portfolio Analytics (PORT <GO>)
● Capital IQ / FactSet: Historical volatility reports and covariance matrices
Standard Deviation
What Is It?
Standard deviation is a statistical measure that captures the amount of variation or dispersion in a
set of data—in this case, investment returns. It is the square root of variance, and it represents the
average distance of individual returns from the mean return, expressed in the same units (e.g.,
percentage) as the returns themselves.
In finance, standard deviation is widely used to quantify volatility, which is a proxy for
investment risk.
Why Is It Important?
Standard deviation is one of the most widely used metrics in risk analysis and portfolio
construction for several reasons:
● It allows for apples-to-apples comparison of risk between different investments.
● Central to the calculation of risk-adjusted performance measures like the Sharpe Ratio.
● Used in Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to define the efficient frontier.
● Helps investors assess the likelihood of extreme return outcomes assuming a normal
distribution.
A higher standard deviation implies greater volatility and, therefore, higher risk, while a lower
standard deviation implies more stable returns.

This is the sample standard deviation, used when calculating from historical data.
Step-by-Step Example:
Given the following returns:
So, the standard deviation of returns is 2.58%.
How Is It Used in This Course?
In the Student Investment Fund, standard deviation is a key input for:
● Comparing Investment Risk: Students assess whether higher-return assets justify their
volatility.

● Sharpe Ratio Calculation: Standard deviation is the denominator in this key risk-adjusted
return metric:
●
Portfolio Optimization: When constructing efficient portfolios, students seek the lowest
standard deviation for a given level of return.
● Backtesting: Standard deviation is used to evaluate strategy consistency across time.
Interpreting Standard Deviation (Under Normality Assumption)
Assuming returns follow a normal distribution:
● ~68% of returns fall within ±1σ of the mean
● ~95% within ±2σ
● ~99.7% within ±3σ
This helps set expectations around best- and worst-case scenarios under stable market conditions.
Tools and Data Sources
● Excel: Use STDEV.S() for sample standard deviation
● Google Sheets: Use STDEV() or STDEVA()
● Python / Pandas: .std() method
● Bloomberg Terminal: HIST <GO>, RISK <GO> for volatility data
● FactSet / Capital IQ: Time-series risk and performance modules
Limitations
● Standard deviation assumes symmetric, normal distribution of returns—less useful in
skewed or fat-tailed return distributions.
● Does not distinguish between upside and downside volatility.
● May understate risk during periods of structural change or crises.

For these reasons, it’s often paired with other risk metrics like Value at Risk (VaR), max
drawdown, or beta.
Beta
What Is It?
Beta (β) is a measure of an asset’s sensitivity to market movements, capturing the portion of total
risk that is systematic, or non-diversifiable. In other words, beta quantifies how much a
security’s return moves in relation to the overall market.
● A beta of 1.0 indicates the asset tends to move in line with the market.
● A beta > 1.0 suggests the asset is more volatile than the market (amplifies movements).
● A beta < 1.0 indicates the asset is less volatile than the market (muted movements).
● A negative beta implies the asset tends to move inversely to the market.
Beta is a core concept in asset pricing, especially in the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).
Why Is It Important?
● Helps investors assess systematic risk—the risk tied to macro-level factors like interest
rates, inflation, or GDP growth that affects all investments to some degree.
● Used to calculate the cost of equity through the CAPM:
● A key input for portfolio management, risk budgeting, and hedging strategies.
● Essential for comparative analysis between securities, especially when building market-
neutral or factor-based portfolios.
Formula:

Example:
Interpretation: The stock is 50% more volatile than the market. If the market increases by 1%,
the stock is expected to increase by 1.5%, all else equal.
How Is It Used in This Course?
In the Student Investment Fund course, beta is applied in several ways:
● Cost of Equity Estimation: Students plug beta into the CAPM formula to determine
discount rates in DCF valuation models.
● Risk Attribution: Decompose a stock’s or portfolio’s total risk into systematic (beta-
driven) and idiosyncratic components.
● Portfolio Construction: Design low-beta, high-beta, or beta-neutral portfolios depending
on market outlook and volatility preferences.
● Performance Analysis: Evaluate how a position contributed to portfolio beta and relative
volatility during various market conditions.
● Backtesting Strategies: Assess how beta impacted performance during bull and bear
markets, and understand its role in factor models.
Tools and Data Sources
● Bloomberg Terminal:
○ BETA <GO> to access historical and regression-based beta

○ Use weekly/monthly data over 1–5 year windows
● Capital IQ / FactSet:
○ Beta relative to different indices (e.g., SPX, Russell 2000)
● Excel / Google Sheets:
○ Use =COVARIANCE.S(asset, market) / VAR.S(market) to calculate manually
● Python / Pandas:
○ Use .cov() and .var() or run a regression of asset returns on market returns
Limitations
● Backward-looking: Historical beta may not reflect future sensitivity.
● Unstable over time: Betas can shift due to changes in business model, capital structure, or
market conditions.
● Ignores idiosyncratic risk: Beta captures only systematic risk, not company-specific risks.
● Assumes linear relationship: CAPM and beta assume returns move proportionally with
the market.
Value at Risk (VaR)
Value at Risk (VaR)
What Is It?
Value at Risk (VaR) is a statistical risk management tool that estimates the maximum expected
loss of an investment or portfolio over a specified time horizon at a given confidence level. It
answers the question:
“What is the worst-case loss I can expect, with X% confidence, over Y time?”
For example, a 1-day VaR of $50,000 at 95% confidence means there is a 95% chance the
portfolio will not lose more than $50,000 in one day.
Why Is It Important?
VaR provides a quantitative measure of downside risk, especially in institutional settings, where
understanding tail risk (rare but significant losses) is crucial.
● Used by banks, hedge funds, and asset managers to comply with risk limits and
regulatory capital requirements.
● Translates volatility into dollar terms, making risk easier to interpret and compare across
positions or portfolios.
● Allows for risk budgeting and stress testing.

VaR is central to risk-adjusted performance evaluation, especially in environments that
emphasize capital preservation.
Formula (Parametric / Variance-Covariance Method):
Common Z-Scores:
Example Calculation:
Assume:
● Daily portfolio standard deviation = 1.2%
● Time horizon = 5 days
● Confidence level = 95% → Z = 1.65
If the portfolio value is $1,000,000:
Interpretation: There is a 95% probability that the portfolio will not lose more than $44,200 over
the next 5 trading days.
Alternative VaR Methods
1. Historical Simulation:

○ Uses actual historical return data to simulate losses.
○ Non-parametric; no assumption of normality.
2. Monte Carlo Simulation:
○ Generates thousands of possible future price paths using random sampling.
○ Accounts for complex instruments and non-normal distributions.
3. Conditional VaR (CVaR):
○ Also known as Expected Shortfall.
○ Measures the average loss in the worst-case tail beyond the VaR threshold.
How Is It Used in This Course?
Students apply VaR to:
● Evaluate tail risk across asset classes or portfolios.
● Compare strategies not just on expected return, but also on potential loss magnitudes.
● Incorporate into risk budgeting and position sizing decisions.
● Use Excel, Python, or Bloomberg to calculate 1-day or 5-day VaR for individual
securities or portfolios.
In presentations or pitch meetings, students may include a VaR analysis to quantify downside
risk exposure and support recommendations on risk limits or hedging strategies.
Tools & Data Sources
● Excel:
○ Manual calculation using standard deviation and Z-scores
○ Use =NORM.S.INV(confidence level) for dynamic Z-scores
● Python / Pandas:
○ Use .quantile() for historical VaR

○ numpy.percentile() for percentile-based estimation
● Bloomberg Terminal:
○ PORT <GO> → Risk Analysis → VaR models
● Capital IQ / FactSet:
○ Integrated VaR in risk reports
Max Drawdown
What Is It?
Max Drawdown is a measure of the largest peak-to-trough decline in the value of a portfolio,
security, or strategy over a specific time period. It quantifies the worst historical loss an investor
would have experienced before a full recovery to the previous high.
Unlike standard deviation or variance, which reflect overall volatility, Max Drawdown focuses
specifically on downside risk and capital loss, making it highly relevant during periods of market
stress or prolonged declines.
Why Is It Important?
● Reflects real-world investor pain, as it shows how far an investment could fall before
bouncing back.
● Used to evaluate a portfolio's resilience, particularly during market crises or bear markets.
● Essential for risk management, as it highlights the worst-case historical loss an investor
might have endured.
● Complements volatility-based metrics, offering a more intuitive understanding of risk
exposure.
● Often used to calculate risk-adjusted return metrics such as the Calmar Ratio:
Typically expressed as a percentage, and always reported as a negative number to indicate loss.
Example:
Assume the following portfolio values:

● Peak Value: $150,000
● Trough Value: $105,000
Interpretation: The portfolio lost 30% of its value from peak to trough before recovering. This
represents the worst observed loss in the time period measured.
How Is It Used in This Course?
In the Student Investment Fund, Max Drawdown is a critical risk metric applied in:
● Backtesting strategies to determine how each approach holds up under market stress.
● Evaluating portfolio construction to ensure downside risk is aligned with the fund’s
mandate.
● Comparing strategies with similar returns to assess risk asymmetry.
● Communicating to stakeholders how a portfolio would have behaved historically in a
crisis (e.g., 2008, COVID-19 crash).
● Used alongside metrics like standard deviation, Sharpe Ratio, and Value at Risk (VaR) to
get a holistic picture of risk.
Max Drawdown vs. Other Risk Metrics
Max Drawdown is particularly important because investors experience losses in dollar terms, not
just statistical deviations—making it highly relevant for practical risk evaluation.
Limitations
● Historical-only: Does not predict future losses—only reports what has happened.
● Doesn’t show recovery time: A strategy may have a deep drawdown but recover quickly
(or not at all).

● Sensitive to time frame: A shorter time series may understate potential risk.
Risk-Return Tradeoff
What Is It?
The risk-return tradeoff is a foundational principle in finance that states:
"To achieve higher expected returns, an investor must accept higher risk."
This relationship reflects the idea that investors require compensation for taking on uncertainty.
Assets or strategies with more volatile or uncertain outcomes must offer higher potential returns
to attract capital. Conversely, lower-risk investments typically offer lower expected returns,
reflecting their relative safety.
Why Is It Important?
● Core to Portfolio Theory: The risk-return tradeoff is central to Modern Portfolio Theory
(MPT), which seeks to construct portfolios that maximize expected return for a given
level of risk.
● Pricing Models: It underpins asset pricing frameworks such as the Capital Asset Pricing
Model (CAPM), which links an asset’s expected return to its systematic risk (beta).
● Strategic Decision-Making: Investors and portfolio managers constantly evaluate whether
higher-return opportunities justify their associated risks.
● Performance Benchmarking: Understanding the tradeoff helps investors compare
portfolios, sectors, and securities on a risk-adjusted basis, using metrics like the Sharpe
Ratio.
Graphical Representation
In risk-return space, this relationship is visualized with:
● The Capital Market Line (CML): Represents the risk-return tradeoff of efficient
portfolios combining the risk-free asset and the market portfolio.
● The Security Market Line (SML): Plots the expected return of an asset based on its beta
relative to the market.
These tools help students and practitioners assess whether an asset offers adequate return for its
risk.
Mathematical Relationships
One way to measure the risk-return tradeoff is by using the Sharpe Ratio. A higher Sharpe Ratio
indicates a more favorable risk-return profile.

Examples of the Trade Off
These tiers illustrate how investors move up the risk spectrum in pursuit of greater returns—each
step requiring greater tolerance for volatility and potential drawdowns.
How Is It Used in This Course?
In the Student Investment Fund, students apply the risk-return tradeoff to:
● Sector and Security Selection: Evaluate whether higher-return sectors (e.g., technology)
justify their increased volatility relative to defensive sectors (e.g., utilities).
● Portfolio Construction: Use diversification to optimize the tradeoff, seeking portfolios
that maximize return for a given level of risk (the efficient frontier).
● Strategy Backtesting: Compare strategies not just on absolute return, but on risk-adjusted
metrics like Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, and Max Drawdown.
● Asset Allocation: Determine appropriate mix between equities, fixed income, cash, and
alternatives based on desired tradeoff profile.
● Pitch Presentations: Justify investment ideas by comparing upside potential to downside
risk, including scenario analysis and stress testing.
Data & Tools
● Bloomberg Terminal: Use PORT <GO> for portfolio-level risk-return plots
● Excel / Python: Simulate return distributions and calculate risk-adjusted performance
● Portfolio Visualizer: Run historical and Monte Carlo simulations of portfolio strategies
● Capital IQ / FactSet: Provide beta, standard deviation, and historical return metrics
Limitations of the Trade Off
● Behavioral Biases: Investors may overestimate return potential or underestimate risk,
leading to poor decisions.
● Non-Linear Risk: In crises, correlations converge and risk increases disproportionately.

● Tail Events: Traditional models often fail to account for black swan events, where losses
are extreme and unexpected.
● Time Dependency: The tradeoff changes across market cycles—what appears high-risk in
one environment may not be in another.
Systematic vs. Idiosyncratic Risk
What Is It?
In investment analysis, risk is not a monolithic concept—it can be broken down into two major
components:
1. Systematic Risk (also called market risk or non-diversifiable risk)
2. Idiosyncratic Risk (also called unsystematic risk or diversifiable risk)
This distinction is crucial in portfolio management because it identifies which risks can be
mitigated through diversification and which are inherent to the market itself.
Systematic Risk
Definition:
Systematic risk refers to macro-level risk factors that affect all investments to some degree. It is
embedded in the overall market environment and cannot be eliminated through diversification.
Examples:
● Interest rate changes
● Inflation and deflation
● Recessions
● Geopolitical events
● Currency fluctuations
● System-wide liquidity crises (e.g., 2008 financial crisis)
Measurement:
● Beta (β) is used to estimate an asset’s exposure to systematic risk.
● Systematic risk is the focus of asset pricing models such as CAPM, where:
Idiosyncratic Risk
Definition:

Idiosyncratic risk arises from firm-specific or sector-specific factors that are independent of the
overall market. This type of risk can be significantly reduced or even eliminated through
diversification.
Examples:
● Product recalls
● Executive misconduct
● Competitive disruption
● Legal issues
● Earnings misses
● Supply chain breakdowns
Measurement:
● Residual risk after accounting for market (systematic) risk in a multi-factor model or
CAPM regression.
● Sometimes modeled as alpha volatility or tracking error.
Why Is It Important?
Understanding the two types of risk allows investors to:
● Focus on managing what can be controlled (idiosyncratic risk).
● Align portfolio beta with market expectations (systematic risk).
● Build diversified portfolios that optimize the risk-return tradeoff.
How Is It Used in This Course?
Students in the Student Investment Fund are expected to:
● Separate systematic and idiosyncratic risk when analyzing securities or industries.
● Use beta to evaluate an investment’s sensitivity to macro conditions (systematic risk).
● Mitigate idiosyncratic risk by constructing well-diversified portfolios across sectors,
geographies, and styles.
● Apply this distinction in:
○ Pitch presentations: "This company has strong fundamentals, but its sector is
highly cyclical, so systematic risk is elevated."
○ Portfolio rebalancing: Reduce overexposure to firms with excessive firm-specific
risk.
○ Backtesting: Identify whether a strategy’s volatility comes from market trends or
stock-specific noise.
Practical Example

Imagine a portfolio of five tech stocks. If one company misses earnings and drops 20%, that’s
idiosyncratic risk. If all five decline due to rising interest rates affecting valuations across the
tech sector, that’s systematic risk.
To reduce idiosyncratic risk, the portfolio might add holdings from different sectors (e.g.,
healthcare, industrials). To manage systematic risk, the portfolio might adjust its overall beta or
hedge using market index ETFs.
Liquidity Risk
What Is It?
Liquidity risk is the risk that an investor will be unable to quickly buy or sell an asset without
causing a significant change in its price or incurring substantial transaction costs. It arises when
there is insufficient market activity or limited depth on the buy or sell side of an order book.
This type of risk is especially pronounced during market downturns, when many investors may
try to exit positions simultaneously, causing liquidity to evaporate and price volatility to spike.
Why Is It Important?
Liquidity risk is critical for several reasons:
● Forced Selling: In times of financial stress, investors may be forced to sell illiquid assets
at large discounts, leading to permanent capital loss.
● Mark-to-Market Losses: Even without selling, valuation markdowns occur if bid-ask
spreads widen or market makers pull away.
● Strategy Execution: Illiquidity can impair the implementation of investment strategies,
particularly for active, short-term, or leveraged approaches.
● Redemption Risk: In fund settings, large investor redemptions may force managers to
liquidate holdings at unfavorable prices.
Assets with higher liquidity risk typically demand a liquidity premium, meaning investors
require higher expected returns as compensation.
Dimensions of Liquidity Risk

Indicators of Liquidity Risk
How Is It Used in This Course?
In the Student Investment Fund, liquidity risk is evaluated during:
● Fundamental Pitches: Students assess whether a security is liquid enough to trade
efficiently without impacting price.
● Small-Cap & Micro-Cap Exposure: These stocks often have higher liquidity risk,
especially in times of volatility or earnings surprises.
● Portfolio Rebalancing: Liquidity is considered when adding or exiting positions—
especially in concentrated portfolios or sectors.
● Risk Management Discussions: Students learn how liquidity stress can magnify losses,
particularly when combined with leverage or correlated positions.
● Exit Strategy Planning: In stock pitches, students are expected to discuss how and when
positions can be exited, taking liquidity into account.
Case Example
A student pitch recommends a small-cap biotech stock with high upside potential. However:
● Average daily trading volume is under 100,000 shares

● Bid-ask spread is 2.5%
● Only a few institutional holders
The student must address whether the expected return justifies the liquidity risk, and how
position size should be adjusted to avoid excessive exposure or difficulty exiting.
Mitigation Strategies
● Position Sizing: Limit allocation to illiquid securities
● Diversification: Avoid overconcentration in illiquid sectors or names
● Liquidity Stress Testing: Model impact of selling positions under market stress
● Avoidance of Leverage: Especially in illiquid instruments where margin calls could force
liquidation
What Is It?
Active and passive management are two distinct approaches to managing investment portfolios:
● Active Management involves making investment decisions to outperform a benchmark
through stock selection, sector rotation, and/or market timing. Active managers rely on
research, forecasts, and analysis to identify mispriced securities.
● Passive Management (also known as indexing) aims to match the performance of a
specific market index (e.g., the S&P 500) by holding the same securities in the same
proportions as the index. Passive strategies do not attempt to outperform the market but
instead focus on cost-efficiency and long-term returns that reflect market performance.
Why Is It Important?
The choice between active and passive management shapes:
● Return expectations
● Risk exposure
● Costs and fees
● Portfolio turnover
● Tax efficiency
It also reflects an investor’s belief about market efficiency:
● If markets are efficient, passive investing is preferred.
● If markets are inefficient, active strategies may exploit mispricings to generate alpha.
This debate is central to modern investing, with trillions of dollars allocated based on this choice.
Key Differences

How Is It Used in This Course?
In the Student Investment Fund, students are expected to:
● Debate and defend both approaches based on market conditions, asset classes, and
investment objectives.
● Pitch active strategies supported by fundamental research, valuation work, or market
insights.
● Evaluate passive strategies for:
○ Benchmarking
○ Strategic asset allocation
○ Low-cost exposure to desired sectors, factors, or themes
● Understand when active adds value—e.g., during volatility, in inefficient markets, or
when ESG or thematic overlays are desired.
● Apply performance attribution to analyze whether returns came from alpha (active skill)
or beta (market exposure).

Performance and Market Trends
● Over the past decade, passive funds have grown significantly, especially in U.S. equities,
driven by fee compression and mixed active manager performance.
● Morningstar and SPIVA (S&P Indices Versus Active) studies show that most active
managers underperform their benchmarks over long time horizons, especially after fees.
SPIVA Scorecard Example:
● Over a 10-year period, ~85% of large-cap active managers underperformed the S&P 500.
Metrics to Compare Active vs. Passive
● Alpha: Excess return over the benchmark
● Information Ratio: Alpha divided by tracking error
● Sharpe Ratio: Risk-adjusted return
● Tracking Error: Volatility of return differences vs. benchmark
● Expense Ratio: Total annual cost as % of assets under management
Asset Allocation Theories
What Is It?
Asset allocation refers to the strategic process of distributing capital across various asset classes, sectors,
and securities to meet a portfolio’s risk and return objectives. While traditional asset allocation focuses on
stocks, bonds, and alternatives, more granular approaches extend into sector, security, factor, and risk-
based weightings.
Effective allocation is the single most important determinant of long-term portfolio performance, often
outweighing individual stock selection.
Sector Allocation & Weightings
What Is It?
Sector allocation involves deciding how much of a portfolio should be allocated to different economic
sectors (e.g., technology, healthcare, energy, financials), typically based on macroeconomic analysis,
business cycle forecasts, and relative valuation.
Why It’s Important:
● Different sectors perform differently depending on economic conditions, interest rate movements,
inflation, and policy changes.
● Sector exposure affects the portfolio’s risk profile, volatility, and cyclicality.
● Sector over- or underweights can be a source of active alpha if done strategically.

Use in This Course:
● Students analyze macroeconomic indicators (e.g., GDP growth, inflation, interest rates) to inform
sector rotations.
● Example: Overweight industrials and materials in early-cycle recoveries; overweight consumer
staples and healthcare in late-cycle environments.
● Compare current fund sector weights against benchmarks like the S&P 500 and justify deviations.
Stock-Specific Allocation & Weightings
What Is It?
This refers to determining how much capital to allocate to each individual security in a portfolio,
balancing conviction, diversification, and risk.
Why It’s Important:
● Allocating too much to one stock can expose the portfolio to idiosyncratic risk.
● Too little allocation can dilute the impact of high-conviction ideas.
● Optimal stock weightings help maximize return per unit of risk.
Use in This Course:
● Students pitch stocks and must recommend specific weightings, often between 1–5% depending
on conviction and risk.
● Learn to scale into positions based on confidence in valuation, earnings catalysts, and downside
protection.
● Practice constructing portfolios with position limits (e.g., no more than 7% in a single stock).
Factor-Based Asset Allocation
What Is It?
This strategy involves allocating capital based on investment factors—quantitative characteristics that
have been empirically shown to drive returns. Common factors include:
Why It’s Important:

● Academic research (e.g., Fama-French, AQR, BlackRock) supports persistent outperformance by
certain factors over time.
● Enables rules-based portfolio construction, reducing behavioral bias.
● Factor exposure can be tailored to match economic regimes or fund objectives.
Use in This Course:
● Students backtest factor strategies (e.g., top decile momentum stocks over 6 months).
● Build factor screens in Excel, Python, or Bloomberg (e.g., value screen = low P/E, low
EV/EBITDA).
● Combine factor models with fundamental research to validate ideas.
● May pitch a multi-factor portfolio with weighted exposure to desired characteristics.
Risk-Based Asset Allocation
What Is It?
Risk-based allocation allocates capital according to each asset’s contribution to portfolio risk, not simply
dollar weights. The goal is to equalize risk across assets, rather than overloading on high-volatility
investments.
Types:
● Risk Parity: Equalizes volatility contribution across asset classes.
● Volatility Targeting: Adjusts exposure to maintain a consistent risk level.
● Minimum Variance Portfolios: Focus on lowest possible overall portfolio volatility.
Why It’s Important:
● Helps build more stable, diversified portfolios, especially in uncertain market environments.
● Reduces concentration in assets that may dominate risk (e.g., equities vs. bonds).
● Supports tail risk mitigation and smoother performance during drawdowns.
Use in This Course:
● Students use standard deviation and beta estimates to build risk parity models.
● Practice using correlation matrices to construct low-volatility portfolios.
● Evaluate portfolio stress tests and adjust allocations to maintain risk targets.
● Integrate volatility targeting in tactical strategies (e.g., increase equity exposure during calm
markets, reduce during high volatility).
Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)
What Is It?

Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), developed by Harry Markowitz in 1952, is a mathematical
framework for constructing investment portfolios that maximize expected return for a given level
of risk, or alternatively, minimize risk for a given expected return.
The theory rests on the principle that diversification reduces risk, not by simply holding more
assets, but by combining assets with uncorrelated or negatively correlated returns to reduce
overall portfolio volatility.
Why Is It Important?
● MPT is the foundation of modern investment management, including index construction,
asset allocation, and risk modeling.
● Introduces quantitative portfolio construction using risk-return optimization.
● Illustrates the trade-off between return and risk (standard deviation) using graphical tools
like the efficient frontier and capital market line.
● Helps investors systematically balance portfolios according to their risk tolerance.
Key Assumptions of MPT
● Investors are risk-averse: they prefer higher returns and lower risk.
● Asset returns are normally distributed.
● Investors make decisions based on mean (expected return) and variance (risk).
● Markets are frictionless (no taxes or transaction costs).
● Investors have homogeneous expectations about returns, variances, and correlations.
Efficient Frontier
What Is It?
The efficient frontier is the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for
each level of risk (or the lowest risk for a given return). It is a curved boundary plotted in mean-
variance space, with portfolios lying below the frontier considered suboptimal.
Why Is It Important?
● Helps investors identify efficient portfolios from thousands of possible combinations.
● Guides allocation by providing a visual representation of optimal trade-offs between risk
and return.
● Forms the basis for deciding which portfolios to consider, depending on investor
objectives and risk tolerance.
Use in This Course:

● Students use Excel Solver or Python optimization libraries (e.g., cvxpy, PyPortfolioOpt)
to construct the efficient frontier using real stock or sector data.
● Analyze how correlations and volatilities between assets affect frontier shape.
● Practice choosing optimal points based on target returns or volatility thresholds.
Capital Market Line (CML)
What Is It?
The Capital Market Line (CML) represents the risk-return combinations of portfolios composed
of a risk-free asset and the market portfolio. It is derived from MPT + CAPM, and is the tangent
line to the efficient frontier.
Why Is It Important?
● Identifies the optimal risk-return combination for all investors through capital allocation
between the risk-free asset and the market.
● Any portfolio on the CML is superior to any portfolio on the efficient frontier (above it),
due to leverage or risk-free lending.
● The market portfolio (point of tangency) is the only risky portfolio investors need,
according to CAPM.
Use in This Course:
● Students use the CML to determine capital allocation lines for investors with different
risk preferences.
● Graph portfolios relative to the CML to identify efficient use of capital.
● Combine CML with investor utility curves to find individually optimal portfolios.

Security Market Line (SML)
What Is It?
The Security Market Line (SML) is the graphical representation of the Capital Asset Pricing
Model (CAPM). Unlike the CML, which plots return vs. standard deviation, the SML plots
expected return vs. beta, measuring only systematic risk.
Why Is It Important?
● Shows how much expected return is required to compensate for systematic risk.
● Stocks above the SML are considered undervalued (offering excess return for risk).
● Stocks below the SML are overvalued (offering insufficient return for their beta).
Use in This Course:
● Students may plot securities on the SML to determine whether they are under- or
overvalued.
● Use CAPM to calculate cost of equity, which feeds into DCF models.
● Helps distinguish between alpha (security selection skill) and beta (market exposure) in
performance attribution.
Portfolio Construction Process
Portfolio Construction Process
What Is It?
Portfolio construction is the process of assembling and managing a collection of investments to
meet a specific set of financial objectives, balancing return expectations with risk constraints,
liquidity needs, tax efficiency, and investment policies.

In institutional settings like a Student Investment Fund, this process is guided by a formal
Investment Policy Statement (IPS) that defines the fund's strategic goals, constraints, and
benchmarks.
Return Requirements
What Is It?
The return requirement is the minimum or targeted rate of return an investor or fund seeks to
achieve over a specified time horizon. It reflects the purpose of the portfolio, whether it be
capital preservation, income generation, or long-term growth.
Why It’s Important:
● Serves as a benchmark against which performance is measured.
● Directly impacts the risk profile of the portfolio—higher return targets often require
riskier assets.
● Influences asset class selection, strategy types, and sector allocations.
Use in This Course:
● Students define a return objective for the fund (e.g., targeting 7–8% annualized return)
based on historical benchmarks like the S&P 500 or Wilshire 5000.
● Investment pitches are evaluated based on contribution to the portfolio's return goal,
relative to their risk and volatility.
Risk Tolerance
What Is It?
Risk tolerance is the investor’s ability and willingness to endure volatility and potential loss. It
incorporates:
● Objective capacity to absorb losses (financial resilience)
● Subjective comfort with uncertainty and drawdowns
Why It’s Important:
● Shapes the asset allocation strategy and portfolio aggressiveness.
● Influences position sizing, security selection, and leverage policies.
● Ensures that the portfolio is aligned with the investor’s psychological and financial
constraints.
Use in This Course:

● Students define risk tolerance in the fund’s investment policy, often as moderate to
moderately aggressive, given the fund’s long-term horizon and educational purpose.
● Risk tolerance guides rebalancing decisions, stop-loss policies, and exposure to volatile
sectors or small-cap stocks.
Tax Considerations
What Is It?
Tax considerations involve analyzing how capital gains, dividends, and interest affect after-tax
returns. Taxes can significantly impact the net performance of an investment if not proactively
managed.
Why It’s Important:
● High turnover strategies can trigger short-term capital gains, which are taxed at higher
rates.
● Dividend-paying stocks may offer tax benefits or burdens depending on the investor type.
● Tax efficiency can compound over time and materially impact long-term performance.
Use in This Course:
● While university endowments may be tax-exempt, students are still trained to think in
tax-aware terms, especially for real-world client scenarios.
● Considerations include:
○ Favoring buy-and-hold for compounding
○ Limiting high-turnover trades without strong conviction
○ Evaluating the tax cost ratio of mutual funds or ETFs
Liquidity Needs
What Is It?
Liquidity needs refer to how quickly and easily a portfolio can be converted into cash without
incurring significant losses. This is especially important for portfolios with short-term
obligations or periodic withdrawal requirements.
Why It’s Important:
● Assets with low liquidity can be difficult to sell during market stress, forcing sales at
depressed prices.
● Liquidity influences the type of assets held (e.g., large-cap stocks vs. private equity) and
portfolio turnover.
Use in This Course:

● Students must ensure that pitches are suitable given the fund’s liquidity needs, typically
assuming quarterly or semi-annual review and rebalancing.
● Avoid investments that are:
○ Thinly traded (low volume)
○ Difficult to value
○ Illiquid in times of crisis
Portfolio Rebalancing
What Is It?
Rebalancing is the process of realigning portfolio weights back to the target allocation. Over
time, asset classes or securities may drift from their original weights due to performance
differences.
Why It’s Important:
● Maintains consistent risk exposure.
● Prevents overconcentration in overperforming assets and underrepresentation of others.
● Ensures adherence to investment mandates and diversification objectives.
Use in This Course:
● Students recommend rebalancing strategies (e.g., threshold-based or calendar-based).
● Analyze performance attribution to determine whether current weights align with macro
outlook, risk tolerance, and conviction.
● Practice selling winners to lock in gains and reallocating to undervalued areas.
Diversification (Stocks, Sectors, Factors)
What Is It?
Diversification involves spreading investments across multiple securities, sectors, and
geographies to reduce idiosyncratic risk and enhance risk-adjusted returns.
Why It’s Important:
● Reduces the portfolio’s exposure to firm-specific or sector-specific shocks.
● Smooths return profiles, especially during volatile markets.
● Improves the likelihood of consistent long-term performance.
Use in This Course:
● Students assess diversification at several levels:
○ Stock-level: Number of holdings and concentration

○ Sector-level: Weights vs. benchmark
○ Geographic/factor-level: Exposure to size, value, momentum, etc.
● Use tools like correlation matrices, beta clustering, and sector heatmaps to evaluate risk
overlap.
Risk-Adjusted Return Metrics
These metrics help investors evaluate how much return an investment generates per unit of risk.
This is critical in comparing strategies or securities that have similar returns but differing levels
of volatility.
Sharpe Ratio
Sharpe Ratio
What Is It?
The Sharpe Ratio, developed by Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe, is a foundational metric in
investment analysis that measures the excess return an investment provides per unit of total risk.
It helps investors understand how efficiently a portfolio is compensating them for the risk taken.
In this context, excess return refers to the return above the risk-free rate, and risk is measured by
the standard deviation of returns, which captures total volatility—both upside and downside.
Why Is It Important?
● The Sharpe Ratio is one of the most widely used tools to evaluate risk-adjusted
performance.
● It levels the playing field by comparing different investments or strategies on a per-unit-
of-risk basis, regardless of their absolute return.
● A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates that an investor is being better compensated for the risk
they are taking.
● It is essential for determining whether an investment’s returns are due to smart decisions
or excessive risk-taking.

Interpretation Guidelines:
Note: These ranges are context-dependent and vary across asset classes and market
environments.
Interpretation: For every unit of total risk, the portfolio is generating 0.67 units of excess return.
How Is It Used in This Course?
In the Student Investment Fund, the Sharpe Ratio is used to:
● Compare portfolio strategies: Evaluate whether one portfolio offers superior performance
relative to its volatility compared to another.
● Justify stock pitches: When presenting a new security, students calculate the Sharpe Ratio
to show that the proposed return justifies the associated risk.

● Backtest and optimize portfolios: Determine which asset combinations or strategies yield
the most efficient returns.
● Communicate performance: Use in quarterly reviews and performance summaries to
explain how well the fund compensated for risk.
Information Ratio
What Is It?
The Information Ratio (IR) is a performance metric that evaluates how much excess return a
portfolio or strategy generates above a benchmark, relative to the volatility of that excess return,
also known as tracking error.
While the Sharpe Ratio compares performance to a risk-free rate, the Information Ratio measures
performance relative to an active benchmark (e.g., S&P 500, sector ETF, or custom composite).
It is particularly useful for evaluating active managers.
Why Is It Important?
● Provides a risk-adjusted measure of active management skill—not just whether a
portfolio outperformed, but how consistently.
● A higher Information Ratio indicates that the portfolio is consistently adding value over
its benchmark without excessive volatility in excess returns.
● Helps distinguish between genuine alpha and random or luck-driven outperformance.
● Commonly used in manager selection, attribution analysis, and quantitative performance
reporting.
Interpretation Guidelines:

The higher the IR, the more reliable the excess return is likely to be.
Interpretation: The portfolio outperformed the benchmark by 2%, with 0.5 units of return per unit
of active risk—moderately positive skill.
How Is It Used in This Course?
In the Student Investment Fund, the Information Ratio is used to:
● Evaluate stock and sector allocations: Did active tilts (e.g., overweighting tech or
underweighting utilities) consistently generate outperformance?
● Analyze active risk: How much tracking error is the portfolio taking relative to its
benchmark (e.g., S&P 500 or Wilshire 5000)?
● Justify stock pitches: Does the proposed investment offer enough consistent alpha to
justify deviating from the benchmark?
● Measure manager value-add: Students running model portfolios or strategy backtests can
use IR to prove their skill vs. luck.
Tracking Error: Understanding the Denominator
Tracking error reflects the volatility of excess returns:

It captures how closely the portfolio hugs the benchmark. A high tracking error means the
portfolio is taking more active risk, which requires higher alpha to achieve a strong Information
Ratio.
Treynor Ratio
What Is It?
The Treynor Ratio, developed by Jack Treynor, is a risk-adjusted performance metric that
evaluates how much excess return a portfolio generates per unit of systematic risk, where
systematic risk is measured by beta (β).
Unlike the Sharpe Ratio, which considers total volatility (standard deviation), the Treynor Ratio
only considers market (non-diversifiable) risk, making it especially relevant for well-diversified
portfolios where idiosyncratic risk has been minimized.
Why Is It Important?
● Allows investors to evaluate portfolio performance relative to its market sensitivity,
rather than overall volatility.
● Particularly useful when comparing well-diversified portfolios, where beta becomes the
dominant source of risk.
● Helps determine whether a portfolio’s return is appropriate for its level of market
exposure.
● Supports the idea that higher beta positions must be justified by proportionally higher
returns.
Interpretation:

A higher Treynor Ratio suggests better compensation for systematic risk. It assumes that
diversification has already eliminated firm-specific (idiosyncratic) risk.
Interpretation: For every unit of market risk taken, the portfolio earned 6.7% in excess return
over the risk-free rate.
How Is It Used in This Course?
In the Student Investment Fund, the Treynor Ratio is applied to:
● Evaluate high-beta holdings: Are riskier assets providing enough return to justify their
market exposure?
● Compare diversified strategies: Since the Treynor Ratio ignores idiosyncratic risk, it’s
ideal for broad portfolios or ETFs.
● Defend pitch ideas: Students proposing high-beta stocks or sectors (e.g., tech, cyclicals)
use the Treynor Ratio to demonstrate value per unit of market risk.
● Discuss market timing or hedging strategies: Beta targeting is part of the conversation
when adjusting the fund’s exposure to macro conditions.

Sortino Ratio
What Is It?
The Sortino Ratio is a refined version of the Sharpe Ratio that measures risk-adjusted return, but
only penalizes for downside volatility—the portion of volatility considered harmful by investors.
Unlike the Sharpe Ratio, which treats all volatility as risky (both upside and downside), the
Sortino Ratio isolates and focuses on returns that fall below a specified threshold, such as the
risk-free rate or a minimum acceptable return (MAR).
Why Is It Important?
● Aligns better with real-world investor preferences, since most investors are concerned
primarily with losses, not upside volatility.
● Provides a more accurate measure of risk-adjusted performance for portfolios or
strategies with asymmetric return distributions, such as:
○ Momentum strategies
○ Long-only equity portfolios
○ Hedge funds with skewed profiles
● Helps distinguish between portfolios that are volatile due to gains and those that are
volatile due to losses.

Interpretation Guidelines:
A higher Sortino Ratio indicates stronger returns for each unit of downside risk.
Interpretation: The portfolio earns 1.5 units of excess return for every unit of downside risk—a
strong risk-adjusted outcome.
How Is It Used in This Course?
In the Student Investment Fund, students apply the Sortino Ratio to:

● Evaluate momentum or long-biased strategies: These often exhibit positive skew—high
volatility due to upside—not penalized by the Sortino.
● Compare portfolios or stocks with similar Sharpe Ratios: A higher Sortino Ratio may
indicate lower downside risk and a more stable return profile.
● Enhance pitch justification: Helps students defend strategies that may appear volatile at
first glance but are actually protective on the downside.
● Backtest asymmetric portfolios: Ideal when assessing return distributions that are not
normally distributed.
Alpha
What Is It?
Alpha is a measure of an investment's excess return relative to the return predicted by its market
exposure, as defined by the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). It represents the portion of
performance that is unexplained by systematic (market) risk and is often interpreted as a measure
of manager skill or strategy value-add.
In essence, alpha isolates the component of return that stems from something other than general
market movements—whether due to stock selection, sector tilts, timing decisions, or strategy
edge.
Why Is It Important?
● Alpha is the purest measure of active management effectiveness.
● A positive alpha indicates that an investment or portfolio is outperforming what is
expected given its beta (market risk).
● A negative alpha suggests underperformance relative to the risk taken.
● Widely used in performance attribution, strategy evaluation, and manager comparison.
This formula represents the actual return minus the expected return from CAPM.

Interpretation:
Interpretation: The portfolio earned 1.3% more than expected based on its market risk. This
suggests value was added beyond beta exposure.
How Is It Used in This Course?
In the Student Investment Fund, students apply alpha to:
● Evaluate investment pitches: Does the stock or strategy produce returns that justify its
market risk?
● Distinguish skill from beta: Analyze whether performance comes from timing, selection,
or just riding the market.
● Backtest strategies: Is the alpha persistent across different timeframes or market
conditions?
● Enhance attribution analysis: Break down sources of return into beta vs. alpha
components.
● Support active vs. passive decisions: Determine whether a deviation from the benchmark
is justified.

Macroeconomic & Industry Analysis
Business Cycle & Economic Indicators
What Is It?
The business cycle refers to the recurring pattern of economic expansion and contraction over
time. These fluctuations in economic activity are measured primarily through gross domestic
product (GDP), employment, consumer spending, and production.
The cycle is generally divided into four stages:
1. Expansion – Increasing GDP, employment, income, and consumer confidence
2. Peak – Economic growth hits its highest point before slowing
3. Contraction (Recession) – Decline in economic activity, rising unemployment
4. Trough – Economic activity bottoms out before beginning to recover
To monitor and predict changes in the business cycle, economists and investors rely on economic
indicators—quantitative data that signal the current state and future direction of the economy.
These indicators fall into three categories:
Why Is It Important?
● The business cycle has a direct impact on asset prices, interest rates, corporate earnings,
and investor sentiment.
● Different sectors and industries perform better in specific phases of the cycle:
○ Early expansion: Consumer discretionary, technology, industrials
○ Mid-cycle: Financials, materials
○ Late cycle: Energy, commodities
○ Recession: Utilities, healthcare, consumer staples
● Understanding macroeconomic conditions helps investors:
○ Adjust sector allocations
○ Manage portfolio risk
○ Time entry and exit points

○ Interpret company performance in context of broader economic trends
How Is It Used in This Course?
In the Student Investment Fund, students are expected to:
● Analyze current economic indicators to determine the fund’s positioning within the
business cycle
● Adjust sector weightings based on macroeconomic outlook (e.g., overweighting staples in
late-cycle environments)
● Support investment theses using macroeconomic context
○ Example: Justify overweight in industrials due to anticipated infrastructure
spending during expansion
● Use real-world data from the Federal Reserve, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and
other sources to build economic dashboards
● Develop forward-looking views through top-down analysis, starting from the macro level
(economy) to the micro level (sector and company)
GDP and Inflation Reports
Overview
Macroeconomic indicators such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and inflation metrics are
foundational to understanding the broader economic environment. These indicators influence
everything from central bank policy to market sentiment, and provide a basis for making
informed investment and sector allocation decisions.
GDP – Gross Domestic Product
What Is It?
GDP measures the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country
over a specific period. It is the broadest measure of economic output and is used to evaluate the
health and growth rate of the economy.
Types of GDP:
● Nominal GDP: Includes current prices (includes inflation)
● Real GDP: Adjusted for inflation, reflects actual economic growth

Why Is It Important?
● Real GDP growth signals economic expansion; contractions may suggest a recession.
● Drives expectations for corporate earnings, interest rates, and risk appetite.
● Used by central banks, economists, and investors to set monetary and fiscal policy.
Where to Find It:
● Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) – www.bea.gov
○ GDP releases are published quarterly, with advance, preliminary, and final
estimates.
○ Data Tool: National Data → GDP and Personal Income
Use in This Course:
● Students track quarterly real GDP growth to gauge economic momentum.
● GDP trends inform sector allocation and market exposure decisions.
● Used in forecasting models and top-down macroeconomic analysis.
Inflation Reports
Inflation reflects the rate at which prices increase across an economy. Investors monitor inflation
closely because it directly affects interest rates, bond yields, equity valuations, and consumer
behavior.
CPI – Consumer Price Index
What Is It?
CPI measures the average change in prices paid by urban consumers for a fixed basket of goods
and services, including housing, food, transportation, and healthcare.
Why It’s Important:
● Most commonly cited inflation metric
● Used to adjust wages, Social Security, and pensions
● Heavily influences Federal Reserve interest rate decisions
Where to Find It:
● Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) – www.bls.gov/cpi
○ Released monthly, typically around the second week of the month
○ Includes Headline CPI and Core CPI (excludes food & energy)
Use in This Course:

● Students monitor CPI to assess inflation risk and Fed sentiment.
● Incorporated into sector strategy (e.g., overweighting staples/utilities in high-CPI
environments).
PCE – Personal Consumption Expenditures
What Is It?
The PCE Price Index measures price changes across a broader range of goods and services than
CPI and accounts for consumer substitution effects.
Why It’s Important:
● Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge
● Considered less volatile and more reflective of actual consumption behavior
Where to Find It:
● Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) – www.bea.gov
○ Released monthly, alongside the Personal Income and Outlays report
○ Track Core PCE (excludes food & energy) and Headline PCE
Use in This Course:
● Students use PCE to align strategies with Fed policy direction.
● Compare to CPI to understand differences in market vs. central bank narratives.
PPI – Producer Price Index
What Is It?
PPI tracks the average change in selling prices received by domestic producers for their goods
and services. It reflects input cost trends and is often a leading indicator of future CPI.
Why It’s Important:
● Reveals cost pressures in the supply chain
● Helps forecast future consumer price inflation
● Useful in evaluating margin risk for sectors like industrials and materials
Where to Find It:
● Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) – www.bls.gov/ppi
○ Released monthly, usually around the second week (same week as CPI)
○ Includes PPI for final demand, intermediate demand, and specific sectors

Use in This Course:
● Students use PPI to assess upstream inflation risk.
● Analyze profitability pressures for pitched companies exposed to rising input costs.
Labor Market Data
Unemployment Rate
What Is It?
The unemployment rate measures the percentage of the civilian labor force that is actively
seeking work but currently unemployed.
Why It’s Important:
● High unemployment suggests economic slack, reduced consumer spending, and potential
downturns.
● Very low unemployment (<4%) may indicate wage pressure and overheating in the
economy.
Where to Find It:
● Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) – www.bls.gov
○ Published monthly, typically the first Friday of each month as part of the
Employment Situation Report.
Use in This Course:
Students use the unemployment rate to:
● Gauge consumer strength and recession risk.
● Predict performance in sectors like consumer discretionary, financials, and industrials.
● Evaluate Fed policy tone (e.g., a falling unemployment rate may lead to more hawkish
messaging).
Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP)
What Is It?
Nonfarm payrolls represent the total number of paid workers in the U.S., excluding:

● Farm employees
● Government workers
● Private household employees
● Non-profit organization employees
It is the most closely watched employment metric in financial markets.
Why It’s Important:
● A high-frequency indicator of real-time economic growth
● Directly affects consumer spending potential, corporate hiring, and market sentiment
● Can be market-moving upon release, especially if results differ from expectations
Where to Find It:
● Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) – www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm
○ Released monthly, part of the Employment Situation Report
○ Includes revisions to prior months, which can also significantly move markets
Use in This Course:
Students use NFP trends to:
● Confirm or challenge economic growth assumptions
● Align sector weightings (e.g., increasing payrolls may support cyclical sectors)
● Compare jobs growth to historical averages (e.g., +150K–250K/month = steady growth)
● Anticipate equity volatility around payroll release days
Other Relevant Labor Metrics to Monitor
Consumer Confidence & Sentiment
What Is It?

Consumer confidence and sentiment indicators measure how optimistic or pessimistic
individuals feel about their personal finances, the current economy, and future economic
prospects. These survey-based indices are essential tools for assessing psychological drivers of
economic activity, particularly consumer spending, which represents more than two-thirds of
U.S. GDP.
Why Is It Important?
● Consumers who feel optimistic are more likely to spend, borrow, and invest, boosting
sectors like retail, housing, autos, and travel.
● Declining confidence or sentiment can precede downturns, as consumers cut back on
discretionary spending.
● These indicators often act as leading economic indicators, reflecting changes in
employment, inflation expectations, interest rate sensitivity, and broader macro
conditions.
Use in This Course:
In the Student Investment Fund, students use consumer sentiment and confidence data to:
● Forecast sector performance, especially in consumer discretionary, retail, and housing
● Support top-down investment theses based on macroeconomic trends
● Compare actual consumer spending behavior with expectations implied by the surveys
● Identify potential inflection points in economic growth or slowdown cycles
Consumer Confidence Index (CCI)
What Is It?
Published by the Conference Board, the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) is derived from a
monthly survey of 5,000 U.S. households. It focuses on:
● Current business conditions
● Employment conditions
● Expectations for income and job market in the next six months
Why It’s Important:
● A higher CCI reflects growing optimism, leading to greater spending and economic
activity.
● A declining CCI often foreshadows reduced consumption, and may signal a slowing
economy.
● The index includes both a "Present Situation" and an "Expectations" component, helping
investors separate short-term from long-term views.

consumer strength
University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index
What Is It?
Compiled by the University of Michigan’s Survey Research Center, this monthly survey focuses
on:
● Personal financial conditions
● Expectations about the economy
● Inflation expectations
It is often seen as more responsive to inflation trends and interest rate changes than the CCI.
Why It’s Important:
● Considered one of the most sensitive indicators of changes in consumer psychology
● Often used by economists and policymakers to anticipate turning points in consumption
and investment
● Includes specific data on expected price changes, giving insight into inflation
expectations

○ Also available through the St. Louis Fed (FRED): fred.stlouisfed.org
Use in This Course:
● Students compare sentiment vs. spending behavior in sectors like autos, travel, and
consumer services

● Use inflation expectation components to evaluate monetary policy implications
● Monitor divergence between CCI and UMich to identify uncertainty or bifurcated
sentiment
Practical Examples in This Course

Federal Reserve Interest Rate Announcements and Government Rates
What Is It?
The Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury provide key interest rate signals that influence the cost of
capital, credit markets, bond yields, and equity valuations. These rates are central to asset pricing,
economic forecasting, and portfolio strategy.
Why Is It Important?
● Interest rate movements directly affect:
○ Equity valuations (via the discount rate in DCF models)
○ Bond pricing and yields
○ Consumer and corporate borrowing costs
○ Currency strength and capital flows
● Sector performance is highly sensitive to rate policy:
○ Financials tend to benefit from rising rates
○ Real estate, utilities, and growth stocks are typically more sensitive to higher rates
● Understanding rate dynamics helps investors anticipate market rotations, inflation pressures, and
Fed responses to economic data.
How Is It Used in This Course?
Students are expected to:
● Monitor and interpret Fed policy announcements
● Adjust sector weightings and duration exposure based on rate expectations
● Use government rates in valuation models (e.g., DCF, WACC, Sharpe Ratio)
● Track yield curve movements to assess recession risk or liquidity tightening
FOMC Meetings (Federal Open Market Committee)
What Is It?
The FOMC is the Fed’s policymaking body responsible for setting the target range for the federal funds
rate and implementing other monetary policy tools. It meets eight times per year.
Why It’s Important:
● Decisions and guidance on interest rates set the tone for credit markets.
● Meeting minutes, projections, and the Fed’s “dot plot” reveal future rate paths.
● Markets react not just to decisions, but to the language and tone of the statement (hawkish vs.
dovish).
Where to Find It:
● Federal Reserve – www.federalreserve.gov

● FOMC statement and minutes are published after each meeting
● Live coverage also available on Bloomberg, CNBC, and financial news sources
Use in This Course:
Students:
● Analyze FOMC minutes and press conferences to interpret the direction of policy
● Discuss effects on sector allocations and market sentiment
● Watch for market reactions to surprise hikes or dovish pivots
Federal Funds Rate
What Is It?
The Federal Funds Rate is the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans. It is the most
influential short-term interest rate in the U.S. and the base rate for monetary policy.
Why It’s Important:
● Influences virtually all other interest rates, including:
○ Credit cards
○ Auto loans
○ Business borrowing
● Affects discount rates in equity valuation models and cost of capital
Where to Find It:
● Federal Reserve (Effective Fed Funds Rate) – fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS
● Published daily by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
Use in This Course:
● Students use the Fed Funds Rate as the short-term benchmark in:
○ CAPM, DCF, and WACC models
○ Asset allocation discussions (e.g., cash vs. equities)
○ Rate-sensitive stock analysis
10-Year Treasury Yield
What Is It?
The 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield represents the interest rate on government debt with a 10-year maturity.
It serves as the risk-free rate for long-term investments and is a proxy for investor expectations about
growth and inflation.
Why It’s Important:

● Affects mortgage rates, corporate bond yields, and equity discount rates
● Closely linked to stock market valuations—as yields rise, future cash flows are discounted more
steeply
● Reflects investor appetite for duration risk and confidence in the economy
Where to Find It:
● U.S. Treasury – home.treasury.gov
● FRED – 10-Year Constant Maturity Rate: fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GS10
● Updated daily
Use in This Course:
● Used as the risk-free rate in DCF models and CAPM
● Included in WACC calculations and bond yield curves
● Helps students assess rate-sensitive sectors (e.g., real estate, utilities)
3-Month Treasury Bill
What Is It?
The 3-month T-Bill is a short-term government security used to gauge short-term investor sentiment and
monetary policy impact.
Why It’s Important:
● Acts as a benchmark for short-term risk-free rates
● Frequently used in performance metrics such as:
○ Sharpe Ratio
○ Sortino Ratio
● Changes in the 3-month T-Bill reflect liquidity preferences, flight to safety, and near-term policy
outlooks
Where to Find It:
● FRED – 3-Month T-Bill Rate: fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DTB3
● U.S. Treasury – Daily auction data
Use in This Course:
● Serves as the risk-free benchmark in Sharpe Ratio and other return metrics
● Used in short-duration bond analysis
● Helps identify yield curve inversions when compared to the 10-Year yield
Yield Curve and Inversions
● When short-term rates (e.g., 3M or 2Y) exceed long-term rates (e.g., 10Y), the yield curve inverts

● Yield curve inversions are a historical predictor of recessions
● Students in this course are expected to:
○ Monitor the shape of the yield curve
○ Discuss its implications for economic outlook and equity allocations
PMI (Purchasing Managers’ Index)
What Is It?
The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) is a survey-based economic indicator that reflects the
health of the manufacturing and services sectors. It is derived from monthly surveys of business
decision-makers in areas such as production, new orders, employment, supplier deliveries, and
inventories.
● A PMI above 50 indicates that the economy is expanding.
● A PMI below 50 suggests contraction.
● A reading of 50 denotes no change from the prior month.
There are two major types:
● Manufacturing PMI: Reflects production and supply chain activity
● Services PMI: Captures demand and business conditions in non-manufacturing sectors
Why Is It Important?
● PMI is a leading indicator, often preceding changes in GDP, employment, and corporate
earnings.
● Signals shifts in business sentiment, consumer demand, and supply chain bottlenecks.
● Closely watched by central banks, investors, and economists to assess real-time economic
momentum.
PMI components often include:
● New orders
● Output/production
● Employment
● Supplier delivery times
● Inventories
How Is It Used in This Course?
Students in the Student Investment Fund use PMI data to:
● Forecast cyclical turns in economic activity and corporate earnings
● Inform sector rotation decisions:

○ Rising PMI: Overweight industrials, materials, financials
○ Falling PMI: Shift toward defensive sectors like staples and utilities
● Assess macroeconomic trends impacting supply chains, labor demand, and pricing power
● Interpret economic surprises: A sharp rise or drop in PMI can move equity and bond
markets, especially if unexpected
Interpreting PMI Readings:
Housing Market & Real Estate
What Is It?
The housing sector represents a major component of the U.S. economy, encompassing:
● Residential construction
● New and existing home sales
● Mortgage lending and rates
● Home improvement spending
● Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
It is highly sensitive to interest rates, consumer confidence, and labor market strength, making it a
cyclical bellwether for the broader economy. Movements in housing activity can signal changes in
economic momentum, credit availability, and household wealth.
Why Is It Important?
● The housing sector contributes directly to GDP through construction, and indirectly via consumer
spending on furniture, appliances, and renovations.
● Housing is often one of the first sectors to slow down or accelerate during economic turning
points.
● Mortgage rates influence affordability, borrowing, and household debt service.
● Real estate also represents a major asset class for both retail and institutional investors, with
REITs offering access to property markets through public equities.

How Is It Used in This Course?
Students in the Student Investment Fund use housing market data to:
● Evaluate investments in REITs, homebuilders, construction firms, and mortgage lenders
● Assess the impact of interest rate changes on consumer credit, household balance sheets, and rate-
sensitive sectors
● Incorporate housing trends into macro forecasts and sector allocation decisions
● Track real estate exposure in the portfolio during rate hikes, inflation cycles, and recessions
Building Permits & Housing Starts
What Is It?
● Building Permits: Number of new residential construction authorizations issued by local
governments
● Housing Starts: Number of actual new homes on which construction has begun
Both are reported monthly by the U.S. Census Bureau.
Why It’s Important:
● Permits are a leading indicator of construction and real estate activity.
● Housing starts impact construction employment, materials demand, and consumer confidence.
● Sudden drops in starts can signal credit tightening or consumer pessimism.
Where to Find It:
● U.S. Census Bureau – www.census.gov/construction/nrc
○ Released monthly, typically around the 17th to 20th of the month
● Also available via FRED:
○ Housing Starts
○ Building Permits
Use in This Course:
● Analyze construction momentum to evaluate companies like Lennar, D.R. Horton, or Home
Depot
● Forecast demand for durables, raw materials, and mortgage services
● Use in top-down analysis to assess cyclical sector exposure
30-Year Fixed Mortgage Rate
What Is It?
The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage—the most common home loan in the U.S.
Why It’s Important:

● Strongly influenced by the 10-Year Treasury yield and Fed policy expectations
● Higher mortgage rates reduce housing affordability and demand
● Impacts homebuilder profits, mortgage lender activity, and household disposable income
Where to Find It:
● Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey (PMMS) – www.freddiemac.com/pmms
● FRED (30-Year Fixed Mortgage Rate):
fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US
○ Updated weekly (Thursdays)
Use in This Course:
● Incorporated into real estate valuation models especially when viewing REITs
● Used to discuss interest rate sensitivity of sectors like real estate, banks, and housing
● Helps forecast housing demand trends and refinancing activity
Additional Housing Metrics to Consider
Impact of Interest Rates on Markets
What Is It?
Interest rates represent the cost of borrowing money and the baseline return for risk-free
investments. Set directly or influenced by the Federal Reserve, interest rates affect nearly all
aspects of financial markets, including:
● Consumer and corporate borrowing costs
● Investment decisions
● Valuation of stocks, bonds, and real estate
● Sector rotation and capital flows
The most closely monitored rates include the Federal Funds Rate, 10-Year Treasury Yield, and
30-Year Fixed Mortgage Rate.

Why Is It Important?
● Higher interest rates tend to:
○ Increase borrowing costs
○ Reduce consumer and business spending
○ Lower equity valuations (via higher discount rates)
○ Slow inflationary pressures
● Lower interest rates typically:
○ Stimulate credit creation and spending
○ Support equity markets, especially growth stocks
○ Encourage risk-taking and capital formation
Understanding these dynamics is crucial for:
● Portfolio construction
● Sector rotation
● Duration management in fixed income
Use in This Course:
Students in the Student Investment Fund:
● Adjust sector allocations (e.g., overweight financials in rising rate environments,
underweight real estate)
● Evaluate interest rate sensitivity in DCF and WACC calculations
● Identify duration risk in fixed income holdings and compare short- vs. long-duration
assets
Example Student Application:
If inflation is rising and the Fed signals more rate hikes:
● Reduce exposure to long-duration tech and growth names
● Increase allocation to value stocks, financials, and short-duration bonds
● Model discount rates accordingly in pitch decks and stock valuations
Business Cycles
What Is It?
The business cycle refers to the fluctuating levels of economic activity over time. It includes
several identifiable stages:

Why Is It Important?
Different phases of the cycle favor different sectors, styles, and asset classes. Recognizing where
we are in the cycle enables investors to:
● Forecast earnings trends
● Adjust exposure to cyclical or defensive sectors
● Manage interest rate and inflation expectations
● Plan for rotational shifts in the market
Use in This Course:
Students are expected to:
● Analyze current macroeconomic indicators (GDP, PMI, employment, inflation) to
determine the stage of the cycle
● Recommend sector weightings that align with the phase (e.g., consumer staples in
recession, industrials in recovery)
● Present macro-overlays in pitch presentations and incorporate cycle awareness into stock
selection
Typical Sector Rotation Across Business Cycle

Sector Performance & GICS Sector Classification
What Is It?
The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) is a widely used taxonomy developed by
MSCI and S&P Dow Jones Indices to categorize publicly traded companies into a consistent
framework. It divides the global economy into 11 sectors, 24 industry groups, 69 industries, and
158 sub-industries.
The 11 GICS sectors are:
1. Information Technology (IT)
2. Health Care
3. Financials
4. Consumer Discretionary
5. Consumer Staples
6. Energy
7. Industrials
8. Materials
9. Utilities
10. Real Estate
11. Communication Services
Each sector represents a distinct part of the economy and responds differently to business cycles,
interest rates, inflation, and investor sentiment.
Why Is It Important?
● Sectors behave differently across economic environments—some thrive in growth
phases, others outperform in recessions.

● Sector rotation—the process of shifting investments between sectors based on macro
trends—is a core strategy in portfolio management.
● GICS allows investors to compare companies within and across sectors, enhancing
benchmarking, risk management, and diversification.
● Helps identify sector-specific risks, such as regulatory changes (e.g., Health Care),
commodity prices (e.g., Energy), or rate sensitivity (e.g., Real Estate).
Use in This Course:
Students in the Student Investment Fund are expected to:
● Understand the composition and drivers of each GICS sector
● Monitor macroeconomic data (e.g., PMI, CPI, interest rates) to anticipate sector
leadership
● Construct and rebalance the portfolio based on:
○ Business cycle positioning
○ Relative valuation metrics
○ Earnings growth outlooks
○ Tailwinds such as innovation, regulation, or consumer trends
Quick GICS Sector Snapshots

Commodities: Crude Oil & Brent Crude
What Is It?
Crude oil is one of the most vital global commodities and serves as the primary energy source for
transportation, manufacturing, and electricity generation. It is also a key input for petrochemical
products like plastics, fertilizers, and synthetic materials.
There are two primary global benchmarks:
● WTI (West Texas Intermediate):
○ A U.S.-based crude oil benchmark
○ Traded primarily on the NYMEX (New York Mercantile Exchange)
○ Known for being lighter and sweeter (lower sulfur content)
● Brent Crude:
○ The global benchmark for oil prices
○ Originates from the North Sea and is used in Europe, Asia, and Africa
○ Traded on the ICE (Intercontinental Exchange)

Oil is traded in U.S. dollars per barrel, and the prices of WTI and Brent often move closely
together—though slight differences in quality and shipping costs lead to a spread between the
two.
Why Is It Important?
Crude oil prices are a major driver of inflation, economic growth, and geopolitical risk. Price
fluctuations impact:
● Energy sector earnings (e.g., ExxonMobil, Chevron)
● Transportation costs and logistics
● Consumer prices (gasoline, heating, goods)
● Trade balances and currency values for oil-exporting/importing nations
● Monetary policy, as central banks respond to oil-driven inflation
High oil prices often act as a tax on consumers, while low prices may stimulate consumption but
hurt energy producers.
Use in This Course:
Students in the Student Investment Fund monitor WTI and Brent prices to:
● Adjust sector exposure, particularly to:
○ Energy (e.g., oil producers, oilfield services, refiners)
○ Industrials and Transportation
○ Materials
● Anticipate inflation pressures, especially in periods of oil price spikes
● Assess geopolitical risks, including supply disruptions (e.g., OPEC+ decisions, Middle
East tensions, Russia-Ukraine)
● Analyze the correlation between commodity prices and equity returns, particularly in
inflation-sensitive portfolios
● Understand the impact on trade balances and global demand across emerging vs.
developed markets
Crude Oil and Sector Impact Table

Technical Analysis & Market Indicators
Technical Analysis
What Is It?
Technical analysis is a method of evaluating securities based on price movement, volume, and
chart patterns, rather than financial statements or intrinsic valuation. It assumes that all available
information is already reflected in the price, and that historical price action can provide clues
about future performance.
Common tools include:
● Candlestick charts
● Support and resistance levels
● Volume trends
● Technical indicators like moving averages, RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands
Unlike fundamental analysis, which seeks to determine what to buy, technical analysis is often
more focused on when to buy or sell.
Why Is It Important?
Even though technical analysis is not a primary focus in SIF, understanding it provides:
● Insight into market sentiment and psychology
● Tools for identifying momentum, potential reversals, or consolidation zones
● A supplementary perspective when timing entries or exits on fundamentally-driven
investments
● An understanding of how short-term traders and algorithmic strategies might influence
price action

In institutional investing, technicals are often used as a timing tool, especially when deploying
large amounts of capital or monitoring near-term volatility.
How Is It Used in This Course?
In the Student Investment Fund, technical analysis:
● Is used sparingly, usually as a secondary layer of insight after fundamental and macro
analysis
● May be incorporated to support:
○ Entry points for a stock pitch
○ Stop-loss or take-profit levels in actively managed positions
○ Market condition assessments (e.g., is the S&P 500 overextended?)
● Can be useful during earnings season, market volatility, or when evaluating high-beta
names
Students are expected to use it judiciously and in context, not as the sole rationale for an
investment.
Price Patterns & Trends
What is it?
Price patterns and trends refer to the recurring formations in price charts that can indicate future
price movements. Trends describe the general direction of an asset’s price over time—either
upward (bullish), downward (bearish), or sideways (consolidation). Common price patterns
include head and shoulders, double tops and bottoms, triangles, and flags.
Why is it important?
Identifying price trends and chart patterns helps investors make more informed trading decisions.
Recognizing whether a stock is in an uptrend, downtrend, or consolidation phase can guide
investment strategies and risk management.
How is it used in this course?
Students in the Student Investment Fund may choose to add additional validity to their pitches by
not only looking at the fundamentals but the technical outlook to see if trends support their
position being taken.
Support and Resistance Levels
What Is It?
● Support is a price level where buying interest is strong enough to prevent further price decline.

● Resistance is a price level where selling pressure prevents the price from rising higher.
These levels often form based on historical price reactions and are watched by many market participants,
creating self-reinforcing behavior.
Why It’s Important:
● Helps identify potential entry/exit points
● Used to set stop-loss and take-profit levels
● A breakout above resistance or a breakdown below support can signal a trend reversal or
continuation
Use in This Course:
● Students use support/resistance to:
○ Evaluate risk-reward ratios
○ Set target prices and manage drawdown risk
○ Identify breakout candidates when aligning technical signals with fundamental conviction
Example:
If a fundamentally strong stock is nearing a historically respected support level, students may initiate a
position with a tighter stop below that level, minimizing downside while maximizing upside if a rebound
occurs.
Moving Averages & Momentum Indicators
What Is It?
● Simple Moving Average (SMA): Average of a stock’s closing prices over a defined period (e.g.,
50-day, 200-day)
● Exponential Moving Average (EMA): Weights recent prices more heavily; reacts faster to price
changes
Momentum indicators assess the speed and strength of a trend:
● RSI (Relative Strength Index): Oscillates between 0 and 100 to indicate overbought (>70) or
oversold (<30) conditions
● MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): Measures the relationship between two
EMAs (commonly 12- and 26-day), with a signal line to trigger buy/sell alerts
Why It’s Important:
● Moving averages help smooth price data and reveal underlying trends
● RSI and MACD help determine entry and exit points, confirm trend direction, and identify
potential reversals
● Used in combination, these tools enhance timing and reduce emotional decision-making

Use in This Course:
● While not primary decision tools, students may:
○ Use moving averages to determine trend direction before entering a position
○ Check RSI and MACD to see if a stock is extended or has momentum tailwinds
○ Pair a technical breakout with a strong fundamental thesis to strengthen pitch confidence
Example Applications:
● 50-day SMA > 200-day SMA (Golden Cross): Bullish trend confirmation
● RSI < 30: May suggest oversold conditions in an otherwise strong company
● MACD crossover above signal line: Indicates potential bullish momentum
Volume Analysis & Market Breadth
What Is It?
● Volume Analysis evaluates the number of shares traded in a given period:
○ Rising prices on high volume = Strong buying conviction
○ Falling prices on high volume = Panic or institutional selling
● Market Breadth gauges the participation of stocks in a market move:
○ Advance-Decline Line (A/D Line): Measures the number of advancing stocks minus
declining ones
○ High breadth = Broad market strength
○ Narrow breadth = Weak or unsustainable rally
Why It’s Important:
● Confirms whether price movements are supported by conviction
● Helps distinguish healthy trends from low-volume noise
● Breadth identifies whether a market rally is robust or fragile
Use in This Course:
● Students may:
○ Use volume spikes to confirm breakout strength
○ Monitor market breadth to assess overall risk sentiment
○ Consider institutional buying/selling patterns when building cases for or against a stock
Example:
A student may identify a breakout in a stock that also shows a volume surge above its 30-day average,
adding credibility to the move and supporting an investment pitch.

Trading & Execution Strategies
Definition: Trading and execution strategies determine how investors place and execute trades in
financial markets. They help maximize efficiency, reduce costs, and optimize trade execution for
better portfolio performance.
Order Types (Market, Limit, Stop, etc.)
Definition: Order types define the conditions under which a trade is executed, affecting price,
timing, and certainty of execution.
What it is?
Order types dictate how a trade is placed in the market. The most common types include:
● Market Orders: Execute immediately at the best available price.
● Limit Orders: Execute only at a specified price or better.
● Stop Orders: Become market orders when the stock reaches a specific price.
● Stop-Limit Orders: Combine stop and limit orders to control execution price.
Why is it important?
Choosing the right order type impacts trade execution, cost, and risk. Market orders offer speed
but can lead to slippage, while limit orders provide price control but may not be executed.
How is it used in this course?
The student investment fund primarily uses limit and market orders, but students may suggest
using different order types when managing the Student Investment Fund to balance execution
speed, price control, and risk when buying or selling stocks.
Liquidity Considerations & Bid-Ask Spreads
What Is Liquidity?
Liquidity refers to how quickly and easily an asset can be bought or sold without significantly
impacting its price. In a liquid market:
● There are many buyers and sellers
● Securities can be traded in large quantities
● The bid-ask spread is typically narrow
● Price slippage is minimal

Illiquid markets, by contrast, have low trading volume, fewer participants, wider spreads, and are
more prone to price distortions during trade execution.
Why Is Liquidity Important?
● Execution Efficiency: High liquidity enables smooth trade execution with minimal
slippage.
● Cost Management: Narrow spreads reduce the hidden cost of trading.
● Market Impact: Large orders in illiquid stocks may move the price, creating adverse
execution.
● Strategy Viability: Liquidity constraints affect the real-world applicability of systematic
trading models or concentrated positions.
How Is It Used in This Course?
In the Student Investment Fund, liquidity is factored into:
● Position sizing decisions to avoid excessive market impact
● Backtesting, where students apply liquidity filters (e.g., min. average daily volume) to
ensure realistic execution
● Security selection, particularly when analyzing small-cap or emerging market equities
● Order type selection, as illiquid securities require more controlled execution strategies
Students are expected to understand volume relative to fund’s trade size before proposing or
executing trades.
Bid, Ask, and Spread: Key Execution Terms
Bid
What Is It?
The bid is the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a security at a given time.
Why It’s Important:
● Reflects demand in the market
● Determines the execution price when selling a security via a market or limit order
● A strong bid supports price stability and depth on the buy side
Ask
What Is It?
The ask (or offer) is the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for a security.

Why It’s Important:
● Represents supply
● Determines the execution price when placing a buy order
● A tight ask (close to the bid) reflects a competitive and liquid market
Spread
What Is It?
The bid-ask spread is the difference between the bid and the ask. It represents the implied
transaction cost or friction of a trade.
Why It’s Important:
● A narrow spread = high liquidity, low cost
● A wide spread = low liquidity, higher cost/slippage
● Impacts profitability, especially in short-term or high-turnover strategies
Trading Volume
What Is It?
Trading volume is the total number of shares traded for a specific security during a given time
period—whether in a day (daily volume), over a week, or over a longer duration. It reflects
market participation, liquidity, and interest in a stock.
● High volume = active trading, strong investor participation
● Low volume = limited activity, potentially low liquidity or interest
Volume is used in both technical analysis and quantitative models as a confirmation signal or
filter for liquidity constraints.
Why Is It Important?
● Confirms price movements: Rising prices on high volume = strong conviction
● Signals market sentiment: Sudden volume spikes may indicate institutional activity or
news
● Affects liquidity and execution: Higher volume generally reduces slippage and improves
trade execution
● Helps assess trend strength and breakout sustainability
For long-term investors, volume also indicates institutional support, and for traders, it’s critical
to entry/exit timing.

How Is It Used in This Course?
In the Student Investment Fund, students use trading volume to:
● Confirm conviction behind price moves when analyzing stocks
● Identify unusual volume spikes linked to earnings, news, or macro developments
● Apply volume filters in backtesting systematic strategies (e.g., ADV > $5M)
● Assess whether a stock has enough liquidity for the fund’s position size
Example:
● If a pitched stock averages only 50,000 shares/day, students may reduce position size or
avoid it altogether to limit execution risk
Slippage
What Is It?
Slippage is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual executed price. It
typically occurs in fast-moving or illiquid markets where prices change between the time a trade
is placed and when it is filled.
Common Causes of Slippage:
● Low liquidity (widened bid-ask spreads)
● High volatility
● Large order size relative to market depth
● Using market orders in thin markets
Why Is It Important?
● Slippage represents a hidden cost that can erode performance
● It undermines the accuracy of backtests and projected returns if not accounted for
● Impacts short-term strategies more significantly, where small differences in execution
price materially affect alpha
Even small slippage can compound over time, especially in active or high-frequency trading
strategies.
How Is It Used in This Course?
Students in the SIF are expected to:
● Be aware of potential slippage when proposing trades in small-cap or volatile names
● Use limit orders to reduce the risk of unexpected price fills

● Incorporate slippage estimates in backtesting systematic strategies and when presenting
results
● Avoid unrealistic assumptions of perfect execution, particularly in low volume or high-
spread names
Example:
If a student backtests a strategy with average daily returns of 0.30%, but average slippage per
trade is 0.15%, the net strategy return is significantly lower than reported. Adjusting for slippage
creates more realistic expectations.
Algorithmic & High-Frequency Trading (HFT)
What Is It?
Algorithmic trading refers to the use of computer algorithms to execute trades based on
predefined rules relating to price, volume, timing, or other market signals. It eliminates the need
for manual trade entry and allows for consistent execution strategies.
Algorithms can be:
● Execution-based: Designed to reduce market impact (e.g., VWAP, TWAP)
● Signal-based: Trigger trades based on technical/fundamental indicators
● Strategy-based: Used in statistical arbitrage, momentum, or factor investing
Why It’s Important:
● Efficiency: Executes trades faster and at more precise prices
● Consistency: Removes emotional bias and human error
● Scalability: Capable of managing multiple positions across assets
● Execution Quality: Can reduce slippage and improve fills in large-volume orders
Use in This Course:
While the SIF does not use automated execution, students may:
● Design or backtest systematic investment strategies with algorithmic logic
● Reference execution algorithms (e.g., VWAP, limit-slicing) when proposing trades in
illiquid or high-ADV names
● Understand the market context shaped by algorithmic activity
High-Frequency Trading (HFT)
What Is It?

High-Frequency Trading (HFT) is a subset of algorithmic trading that uses ultra-fast computers
and data feeds to execute thousands of trades in microseconds. HFT strategies include:
● Market making
● Latency arbitrage
● Statistical arbitrage
● Event-driven trades
HFT firms often profit from small price inefficiencies, repeated at scale.
Why It’s Important:
● Contributes to liquidity and tighter spreads
● Facilitates price discovery through rapid quote adjustment
● Raises concerns about volatility, fairness, and market stability
Use in This Course:
Students may explore HFT in discussions related to:
● Liquidity conditions
● Execution risks
● Systematic volatility
● Events like the 2010 Flash Crash, where HFT exacerbated a rapid market collapse and
recovery within minutes
HFT’s Impact on Markets
What Is It?
HFT has both benefits and drawbacks for the functioning of public markets.
Benefits:
● Increased liquidity
● Tighter bid-ask spreads
● Faster arbitrage across exchanges
Risks:
● Market instability in volatile periods
● Quote stuffing (rapid placement and cancellation of orders to mislead competitors)
● Flash crashes from cascading algorithmic behavior
● Reduced price transparency for long-term investors

Why It’s Important:
Understanding HFT allows investors to:
● Anticipate short-term volatility
● Be cautious around illiquid stocks, especially during low-volume trading sessions
● Recognize the limitations of limit/market orders in HFT-dominated markets
Use in This Course:
Students should:
● Be aware of HFT's role in liquidity and price movements
● Use liquidity filters and slippage modeling in backtests to reflect potential HFT
interactions
● Study past events (e.g., Flash Crash, GameStop short squeeze) where HFT behavior
influenced price action
Dark Pools
What Are They?
Dark pools are private trading venues where institutional investors can trade large blocks of
securities without revealing their intentions to the public market. Unlike public exchanges (e.g.,
NYSE, NASDAQ), dark pools do not display order books.
Why Institutions Use Them:
● Minimize market impact
● Avoid price movement before or during execution
● Maintain anonymity for large-scale trades
Benefits:
● Allows efficient execution of block trades
● Preserves confidentiality for large investors
● Can reduce slippage and trading costs
Risks and Criticisms:
● Lack of transparency
● Potential for information asymmetry
● Regulatory scrutiny over fairness and access
Use in This Course:

While SIF does not trade through dark pools, students may:
● Evaluate institutional behavior related to dark pool usage when analyzing large volume
movements
● Consider how dark pool activity can delay price discovery or cause discrepancies
between reported volume and actual liquidity
● Understand how block trades may be executed without distorting market prices

ESG & Impact Investing
Principles of ESG Investing
What Is It?
ESG investing—short for Environmental, Social, and Governance investing—refers to the
process of incorporating non-financial factors into investment analysis and portfolio construction
to better assess risks and opportunities over the long term.
ESG investing goes beyond traditional financial metrics and focuses on how companies manage:
● Environmental: Climate change, resource usage, pollution, carbon footprint, energy
efficiency
● Social: Labor practices, workplace diversity, community engagement, product safety,
supply chain ethics
● Governance: Board structure, executive compensation, shareholder rights, transparency,
corporate ethics
This framework helps evaluate a company’s ability to operate responsibly, sustainably, and
profitably over time.
Why Is It Important?
ESG investing is no longer niche—it is a mainstream discipline that reflects the growing
awareness that sustainability, ethics, and governance have material financial impacts.
Key benefits include:
● Risk Management: ESG factors reveal risks not captured in balance sheets (e.g., climate
litigation, labor unrest, regulatory backlash)
● Long-Term Performance: Companies with strong ESG scores often demonstrate lower
volatility, better stakeholder alignment, and more resilient cash flows
● Value Alignment: ESG enables institutions and individuals to invest in accordance with
their values, without sacrificing returns
● Capital Flows: Growing investor demand for ESG products (e.g., ESG ETFs, green
bonds) is reshaping capital allocation globally
How Is It Used in This Course?
● Dedicated ESG Portfolio: One of the fund’s portfolios is fully ESG-compliant, meaning
all positions must pass ESG screening and materiality assessment.

● Screening & Scoring: Students are expected to analyze ESG scores from sources such as
MSCI, Sustainalytics, or Bloomberg ESG, and identify strengths and weaknesses across
the E, S, and G pillars.
● Investment Pitches: ESG considerations must be incorporated into pitch decks,
particularly for companies with:
○ High climate exposure (e.g., energy, transportation)
○ Complex governance structures (e.g., dual-class shares)
○ Supply chain or reputational risk (e.g., apparel, technology)
● ESG Materiality: Students learn to distinguish material ESG factors by industry, using
tools like the SASB Materiality Map or TCFD frameworks.
ESG vs. Traditional Investing
What Is It?
Traditional investing relies on financial performance metrics—such as revenue growth,
profitability, cash flows, valuation multiples (e.g., P/E, EV/EBITDA), and return on equity—to
identify opportunities and manage risk. It focuses on maximizing shareholder value based on
historical and projected financials.
ESG investing, by contrast, expands this analysis by incorporating Environmental, Social, and
Governance (ESG) considerations. ESG investors analyze:
● Environmental risks (e.g., carbon emissions, water usage)
● Social factors (e.g., labor practices, product safety)
● Governance practices (e.g., board composition, audit independence)
These non-financial factors aim to identify long-term risks and opportunities that may not be
captured by traditional financial models but have material impacts on a company’s future
performance and valuation.
Key Differences Between ESG and Traditional Investing

Why Is It Important?
1. Captures Long-Term Risk: Traditional analysis may miss systemic threats like climate
risk, governance scandals, or labor issues—all of which can damage brand equity and
financials.
2. Reflects Evolving Market Standards: Global capital flows are increasingly influenced by
regulators, asset owners, and consumers demanding corporate responsibility and
transparency.
3. Supports Forward-Looking Analysis: ESG provides early insight into emerging risks and
competitive advantages that may not yet appear in earnings reports.
4. Improves Investment Alignment: ESG investing allows institutions and individuals to
align portfolios with ethical or mission-driven objectives, such as decarbonization or
workplace equality.
How Is It Used in This Course?
● Side-by-side company analysis: Students compare financially similar firms with differing
ESG profiles to assess risk-adjusted return trade-offs.
● ESG-integrated valuation models: Traditional DCF and multiples-based models are
enhanced by adjusting for ESG risks and opportunities.
● Backtesting & performance review: Students evaluate historical performance of ESG-
screened portfolios vs. traditional benchmarks (e.g., S&P 500 vs. ESG versions like S&P
500 ESG Index).
● Pitch integration: Every student pitch must consider whether ESG factors strengthen or
weaken the investment thesis.

Example: A traditional pitch for a profitable oil company might highlight dividend yield and free
cash flow. An ESG-integrated pitch may downweigh the stock due to stranded asset risk, poor
governance scores, or rising carbon taxes that could impair long-term value.
Trade-Offs and Realities
The Three Pillars of ESG: Environmental, Social, and Governance
ESG investing is structured around three distinct but interconnected pillars: Environmental (E),
Social (S), and Governance (G). Together, these pillars provide a framework for analyzing a
company’s non-financial performance—which can have material financial implications over the
short and long term.
In the Student Investment Fund, understanding and evaluating each of these categories is critical
for ESG portfolio management and risk assessment.
Environmental (E)
What Is It?
Environmental criteria assess a company’s impact on the natural world. Key focus areas include:
● Carbon emissions
● Greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity
● Climate risk disclosures
● Water and energy usage
● Waste management and pollution
● Sustainable resource sourcing
● Transition to clean energy

These factors are particularly relevant in carbon-intensive sectors such as energy, utilities,
transportation, and materials.
Why It’s Important:
● Environmental risks (e.g., rising carbon costs, climate regulation) can materially impact
profit margins, supply chains, and asset valuations
● Poor environmental performance increases exposure to regulatory fines, consumer
backlash, and stranded assets
● Positive environmental leadership can attract ESG-focused capital and reduce operational
risk
How Is It Used in This Course?
In SIF, students:
● Review company-reported carbon disclosures, emission targets, and energy usage trends
● Analyze environmental controversies or fines
● Adjust portfolio exposure in sectors where climate transition risk is high
● Use resources like Bloomberg ESG, MSCI ESG scores, and CDP climate data
Example: A student may flag a chemical manufacturer with rising carbon intensity and
insufficient emissions disclosures as a divestment candidate, even if the company shows strong
financial metrics.
Social (S)
What Is It?
Social factors evaluate how companies interact with stakeholders, including employees,
customers, communities, and suppliers. Core elements include:
● Labor standards and worker rights
● Health and safety protocols
● Workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)
● Human rights in global supply chains
● Customer data privacy
● Community engagement and philanthropy
● Product safety and recalls
Social issues can span industries but are especially important in consumer goods, retail,
technology, and manufacturing.
Why It’s Important:

● Strong social performance contributes to brand value, employee retention, and customer
trust
● Poor social practices can trigger lawsuits, boycotts, and regulatory scrutiny
● Social metrics provide early insight into reputational risk and organizational culture
How Is It Used in This Course?
SIF students:
● Evaluate employee turnover, DEI initiatives, and Glassdoor reviews
● Consider exposure to supply chain controversies (e.g., forced labor, unsafe conditions)
● Assess how companies support community resilience and respond to social unrest
● Use third-party sources like Sustainalytics, ISS ESG, and company social impact reports
Example: A student pitching a fast-fashion retailer may assess whether its suppliers adhere to
ethical labor standards and how the company responds to media scrutiny over working
conditions.
Governance (G)
What Is It?
Governance refers to the internal systems and controls that guide corporate decision-making and
ensure accountability to shareholders. Governance factors include:
● Board composition and diversity
● Executive compensation policies
● Audit committee independence
● Shareholder voting rights
● Anti-corruption practices
● Succession planning
● Transparency and disclosure standards
Governance is sector-agnostic, but is especially critical in financial services, emerging markets,
and founder-led companies.
Why It’s Important:
● Poor governance can lead to fraud, restatements, scandals, and value destruction
● Strong governance reduces agency risk and ensures management acts in the best interest
of shareholders
● Governance influences a firm’s ability to adapt, navigate crises, and engage with
stakeholders

How Is It Used in This Course?
SIF students:
● Analyze board structures, independent director ratios, and voting power concentrations
● Flag companies with dual-class share structures or weak shareholder protections
● Monitor proxy voting records and activist investor involvement
● Discuss governance controversies (e.g., CEO overreach, audit failures) when evaluating
risk
Example: A student might downgrade a tech company pitch after discovering it has no
independent board members and opaque compensation practices, increasing governance risk.
Students are encouraged to integrate E, S, and G factors into both quantitative screens and
qualitative case studies—ensuring that financial performance is viewed alongside sustainability
and risk management.
Sustainable & Responsible Investing Trends
What Is It?
Sustainable and Responsible Investing (SRI) represents a broad shift in capital markets, where
investors demand that companies operate with a heightened sense of ethics, sustainability, and
accountability. SRI emphasizes the integration of ESG factors into investment decisions
alongside traditional financial analysis.
Key SRI trends include:
● Green Bonds: Debt instruments used to fund environmentally beneficial projects
● ESG Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): Passive investment vehicles that screen for ESG
criteria
● Impact Investing: Targeting measurable social or environmental outcomes alongside
financial returns
● Shareholder Activism: Engaging with or pressuring companies to improve ESG
performance through proxy voting or proposals
● Net-Zero Pledges: Asset managers aligning portfolios with carbon neutrality goals
Why It’s Important
These trends represent paradigm shifts in investor behavior, with over $35 trillion in ESG-
aligned assets globally (as of 2023), and growing regulatory pressure for ESG disclosures from
the SEC, EU, and other global bodies.
SRI trends impact:

● Capital flows: Companies with strong ESG profiles attract long-term investors and
benefit from a lower cost of capital
● Valuation: Sustainability leadership can support premium multiples, while ESG
controversies may lead to valuation compression
● Reputational risk: Investors now consider how firms align with their own values and
brand reputation
● Regulatory alignment: ESG-focused strategies help investors prepare for evolving global
policy (e.g., carbon taxes, climate disclosure rules)
How It’s Used in This Course
In the Student Investment Fund, students are expected to:
● Analyze how SRI trends influence asset pricing, sector rotation, and valuation premiums
● Evaluate ESG ETFs and green bonds as alternatives or complements to traditional asset
classes
● Assess the role of shareholder engagement and proxy voting in improving ESG outcomes
● Track how real-world events (e.g., oil spills, data privacy breaches, unionization efforts)
influence investor sentiment and capital allocation
Example: A student might evaluate whether a company recently added to a low-carbon ETF is
experiencing improved stock performance due to increased passive flows from ESG investors.
Measuring ESG Performance & Risks
What Is It?
Measuring ESG performance and risk involves using quantitative and qualitative data to assess
how companies manage sustainability challenges and opportunities. Investors leverage both
third-party ESG scores and internal analyses to evaluate company-level risks, trends, and
alignment with responsible investing goals.
Core components of ESG measurement:
● ESG Scores: Composite ratings from data providers (e.g., MSCI, Sustainalytics,
Bloomberg ESG, Refinitiv)
● Controversy Flags: Red flags tied to litigation, scandals, or regulatory breaches
● Carbon Footprint Analysis: Total GHG emissions per dollar of revenue or per share
● Materiality Mapping: Identifying industry-specific ESG risks using frameworks like
SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board)
● Risk Exposure Ratings: Evaluation of how ESG issues may financially impact the firm
Why It’s Important

● Standardizes ESG Comparisons: Enables benchmarking across companies and sectors
● Supports Risk Management: Identifies red flags that may not be apparent in financials
● Improves Transparency: Enhances disclosure accountability and stakeholder engagement
● Aligns Portfolios with Values: Helps screen for mission-aligned or impact-focused
investments
Poor ESG performers often face:
● Higher borrowing costs
● Increased volatility
● Greater regulatory scrutiny
● Weaker long-term shareholder loyalty
How It’s Used in This Course
SIF students are expected to:
● Use ESG scores from providers like Bloomberg ESG, Sustainalytics, and MSCI to
compare potential investments
● Integrate ESG risk analysis into stock pitches, identifying potential controversies or
sustainability risks that affect valuation
● Use materiality maps (e.g., from SASB) to focus on ESG risks most relevant to each
industry
● Build or apply custom ESG scoring frameworks for portfolio monitoring
Example: A team might pitch divesting from a logistics company with high emissions intensity
and a low MSCI Environmental Pillar score, proposing a shift to a competitor with better
environmental practices and equivalent financials.
MSCI ESG Ratings
What Is It?
MSCI ESG Ratings evaluate companies on a scale from AAA (leader) to CCC (laggard) based
on their exposure to material ESG risks and how effectively they manage those risks relative to
industry peers.
● Ratings are sector-relative, not absolute
● Scores reflect both risk exposure and management effectiveness
● Covers 10 key ESG themes across Environmental, Social, and Governance categories
Why It’s Important:
● Helps investors identify ESG leaders and laggards within sectors

● Provides insight into risk-adjusted return potential
● Used by institutional investors to screen investments and benchmark performance
How It’s Used in This Course:
Students use MSCI ratings to:
● Filter stocks in ESG-compliant portfolios
● Compare companies within a sector based on ESG resilience
● Justify overweighting/underweighting positions
● Evaluate performance dispersion between ESG leaders and laggards
Example: A student may prefer a company rated AA over a peer rated BB, even if both have
similar financial metrics, due to stronger risk management and sustainability practices.
S&P Global ESG Scores
What Is It?
S&P Global ESG Scores are based on the Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA)—a
detailed annual survey and data-collection process evaluating ESG performance across 20+
industry-specific topics.
● Scores are given on a scale of 0–100
● Emphasis on preparedness, disclosure quality, and performance
● CSA includes qualitative disclosures, quantitative metrics, and policy evaluations
Why It’s Important:
● Offers granular, forward-looking insights into a company’s ESG strategy
● Includes peer benchmarking, sector-specific materiality, and transparency
● Used in sustainability indices (e.g., Dow Jones Sustainability Indices)
How It’s Used in This Course:
Students use S&P ESG scores to:
● Conduct deeper peer comparisons
● Assess whether a company is improving or declining in ESG preparedness
● Identify firms suitable for engagement, monitoring, or divestment
● Evaluate whether the fund’s holdings align with sustainability benchmarks
Example: If the ESG portfolio holds companies that ranks in the bottom quartile of its sector’s
CSA scores, students may flag it for review and propose engagement or replacement.

Bloomberg ESG Scores
What Is It?
Bloomberg ESG Scores are derived from publicly available company disclosures, including
annual reports, sustainability reports, and regulatory filings. Unlike MSCI or S&P, Bloomberg
does not use surveys or private assessments.
● Scores are quantitative and focus on transparency and disclosure completeness
● Coverage includes Environmental, Social, and Governance pillars
● Integrated directly into Bloomberg Terminal analytics (e.g., ESG <GO>, FA ESG tab)
Why It’s Important:
● Offers real-time ESG data to institutional investors and analysts
● Emphasizes disclosure quality, which is often a leading indicator of ESG governance
● Enables sector-wide screening, peer ranking, and historical trend analysis
How It’s Used in This Course:
Students with access to Bloomberg Terminals use ESG Scores to:
● Pull ESG data for screening or backtesting
● Compare ESG disclosure levels across companies and sectors
● Add quantitative support to investment theses or divestment proposals
● Identify data gaps or transparency risks in current holdings
Example: A student pitching a company may pull its Bloomberg ESG dashboard to show a lack
of environmental disclosure and compare it against sector peers or show how it is better than its
peer group and should be included in the ESG portfolio.
Comparison of ESG Rating Systems

Negative Screening
What Is It?
Negative screening involves excluding companies or sectors from an investment universe based
on specific ESG criteria. Typically, investors remove firms that are involved in activities deemed
inconsistent with certain ethical, environmental, or social standards. Common exclusions
include:
● Fossil fuels
● Defense and weapons manufacturing
● Tobacco
● Gambling
● Alcohol
● Controversial business practices (e.g., severe environmental damage or human rights
abuses)
Why Is It Important?
● Ethical Alignment: Negative screening allows investors to ensure that their portfolios
reflect their values or mission-based objectives.
● Risk Management: By removing companies with high ESG risks, investors can mitigate
potential reputational or regulatory risks.
● Investor Demand: Growing numbers of investors and institutions require portfolios that
align with social or environmental ideals.
How Is It Used in This Course?

● Portfolio Construction: Students apply negative screens to remove companies that do not
meet the fund’s ESG criteria, ensuring that the investable universe aligns with ethical
standards.
● Strategy Differentiation: Some groups may choose to implement an "anti-ESG" strategy
for one of the fund’s core portfolios to compare performance and risk profiles against
ESG-compliant strategies.
Positive Screening
What Is It?
Positive screening targets companies with strong ESG performance. This approach involves
selecting firms that are leaders in:
● Sustainability practices
● Environmental innovation
● Social responsibility
● Robust governance structures
Investors use positive screening to overweight companies that demonstrate best-in-class ESG
performance and actively contribute to sustainability.
Why Is It Important?
● Value Creation: Companies with strong ESG performance may be more resilient, face
lower regulatory risk, and be better positioned for long-term success—potentially
generating alpha.
● Support for Sustainability Leaders: Positive screening channels capital toward companies
that are driving sustainable innovation and practices, reinforcing their market position.
● Enhanced Risk-Adjusted Returns: Firms that excel in ESG factors may also offer more
stable cash flows and better risk management, leading to superior risk-adjusted
performance.
How Is It Used in This Course?
● Stock Selection: Students use positive screening tools, such as ESG ratings from MSCI,
S&P Global, or Bloomberg, to overweight companies with superior ESG scores in the
portfolio.
● Pitch Development: Investment pitches are enhanced by highlighting the ESG strengths
of a company, demonstrating that it is both a strong financial performer and a leader in
sustainability.
● Performance Analysis: Students backtest the performance of ESG portfolios to evaluate
whether top ESG performers contribute to improved risk-adjusted returns compared to a
broader market benchmark.



Systematic Investing
Systematic vs. Discretionary Investing
What Is It?
Systematic investing involves using rule-based models, algorithms, or quantitative signals to
make investment decisions. These models rely on objective criteria derived from data—such as
price movements, earnings reports, or macroeconomic indicators—and are implemented
consistently across markets and timeframes.
Discretionary investing, on the other hand, relies on the judgment, intuition, and experience of a
portfolio manager or analyst. It emphasizes qualitative analysis, including company management
interviews, industry trends, and thematic insights that may not be captured in data alone.
Why Is It Important?
Understanding the distinction between systematic and discretionary investing helps students and
practitioners:
● Align strategies with investor goals (e.g., consistency vs. flexibility)
● Understand how different styles perform in various market environments
● Assess resource needs (e.g., computing power for systematic, research depth for
discretionary)
● Build portfolios that combine the strengths of both approaches
How Is It Used in This Course?
In the Student Investment Fund, students are exposed to both investment styles:
● Systematic strategies: Students build rule-based models using quantitative signals (e.g.,
momentum, volatility, valuation screens). These are typically backtested to evaluate
performance across historical market cycles.
● Discretionary strategies: Students prepare fundamental stock pitches, applying deep
company analysis, macro context, and judgment to form a recommendation.
By comparing both methods, students gain a balanced view of how to blend data-driven rigor
with qualitative insight.
Example: A student may use a systematic filter to screen for undervalued stocks with high
return-on-equity, then apply discretionary analysis to choose the most compelling company from
the list for a formal pitch.

Advantages of Systematic Investing
What Is It?
Systematic investing provides a structured, repeatable, and testable framework for investment
decisions. It offers several key benefits:
● Consistency: Investment decisions are made according to pre-defined rules, reducing the
influence of human emotions, bias, and noise.
● Scalability: Models can be applied to thousands of securities across regions and asset
classes, making them ideal for large portfolios or complex mandates.
● Backtestability: Strategies can be evaluated using historical data to assess expected
performance, drawdowns, and risk characteristics before implementation.
● Risk Management: Exposure limits, stop-loss rules, and position sizing can be
programmed directly into the model, ensuring consistent application of risk parameters.
Why Is It Important?
Systematic investing is particularly valuable when:
● Managing large amounts of data
● Seeking objectivity in volatile or uncertain markets
● Creating rules-based ESG screens, factor strategies, or quant-driven portfolios
● Needing strategies that can be replicated or automated with high confidence
It enables institutional-grade investment processes that emphasize discipline and transparency.
How Is It Used in This Course?
Students in the Student Investment Fund:
● Build their own systematic models using tools like Excel, Python, or Bloomberg
● Implement rules based on valuation, momentum, volatility, or ESG metrics
● Apply backtesting frameworks to evaluate model performance, turnover, and Sharpe ratio
● Learn to balance model design with real-world constraints such as liquidity, slippage, and
rebalancing costs
Example: A student might build a model that invests in the top 10 companies in the Russell 1000
with the highest 6-month momentum and lowest beta, rebalanced monthly. They would then
compare the results against the S&P 500 and a discretionary pitch in the same sector.
Systematic vs. Discretionary Comparison Table

Data-Driven Investment Process
What Is It?
A data-driven investment process refers to the systematic use of structured, empirical data—such
as price history, financial statements, macroeconomic indicators, and alternative datasets—to
guide every phase of the investment decision-making cycle.
This approach is particularly common in systematic investing, quantitative research, and
algorithmic strategy design. It emphasizes objectivity, repeatability, and transparency, making it
a cornerstone of modern portfolio management and a core focus in this course.
Core Steps of a Data-Driven Process
The process typically unfolds in five stages:
1. Data Collection
● Goal: Gather clean, reliable data as the foundation for research and modeling.
● Types of Data:
○ Market data: Price, volume, volatility, bid-ask spreads
○ Fundamental data: Earnings, book value, cash flow, analyst estimates
○ Macroeconomic data: Interest rates, GDP, CPI, unemployment
○ Alternative data: Satellite imagery, web traffic, ESG scores
● Sources: Bloomberg, Capital IQ, FactSet, Yahoo Finance, Federal Reserve Economic
Data (FRED), Quandl
2. Signal Generation

● Goal: Translate raw data into actionable investment signals using models, indicators, or
rules.
● Examples:
○ Value: Buy stocks with the lowest P/E or highest FCF yield
○ Momentum: Rank stocks based on trailing 6-month return
○ Macro: Favor sectors that outperform during rate cuts
● Techniques:
○ Regression models, ranking algorithms, factor scoring
○ Machine learning (e.g., decision trees, clustering, classification)
3. Portfolio Construction
● Goal: Allocate capital across securities in a way that reflects signal strength, risk
tolerance, and portfolio objectives.
● Methods:
○ Equal weighting, risk-parity, or factor tilting
○ Optimization techniques such as mean-variance optimization, Black-Litterman
model
● Constraints may include:
○ Sector exposure
○ ESG compliance
○ Position limits
○ Liquidity thresholds
4. Execution
● Goal: Implement investment ideas in real markets with minimal cost and slippage.
● Execution factors:
○ Order types (limit, market, stop)
○ Transaction cost estimation
○ Liquidity screens (e.g., min daily volume)
○ Timing and trade scheduling
● May include simulated execution in backtesting, or real-time orders in live trading.
5. Monitoring & Evaluation
● Goal: Track portfolio performance, evaluate the accuracy of signals, and refine strategies
over time.
● Metrics Monitored:
○ Portfolio return, volatility, Sharpe ratio
○ Hit rate (signal success rate), drawdown, turnover
○ ESG score compliance (if applicable)

● Post-trade analysis evaluates how well the strategy performed versus expectations and
identifies areas for adjustment.
Why Is It Important?
A data-driven process:
● Enhances transparency: Every decision can be traced back to data and rules.
● Reduces emotion: Investors avoid reactionary behavior based on headlines or sentiment.
● Allows backtesting: Strategies can be tested over decades of data before deployment.
● Scales effectively: Can be applied across large universes with consistency.
● Enables adaptation: Performance evaluation informs timely model adjustments.
This approach is critical in modern investment management, where technology, data availability,
and competition demand rigorous and objective methodologies.
How Is It Used in This Course?
Students in the Student Investment Fund apply this process by:
● Collecting and cleaning datasets (e.g., daily prices, valuation ratios, sector classifications)
● Designing investment signals using factors like momentum, volatility, or macro
sensitivity
● Constructing portfolios using ranking models or optimization
● Running backtests to measure performance, risk, and turnover
● Presenting results with clear attribution of alpha to data-driven insights
They also learn to:
● Avoid data snooping (overfitting to historical patterns)
● Assess out-of-sample robustness
● Compare systematic strategies to discretionary investment theses
Example: A student team builds a strategy that selects the top 10 large-cap stocks with upward
earnings revisions and 6-month momentum, rebalanced monthly. The team backtests it over 5
years and compares the performance to a discretionary pitch on a single company.
Types of Systematic Strategies
Factor Investing
What Is It?
Factor investing is a systematic investment strategy that seeks to capture long-term sources of
return by targeting quantifiable characteristics—known as factors—that have been empirically

shown to explain the performance and risk of securities. Each factor represents a specific,
repeatable driver of return, grounded in either risk premia, behavioral inefficiencies, or market
structure anomalies.
Factor investing bridges the gap between active management and passive indexing, creating
rules-based portfolios that tilt exposure toward return-enhancing attributes without relying on
subjective judgment.
Key Factors and Their Characteristics
These factors are not mutually exclusive. Multi-factor models combine several to enhance
diversification and reduce reliance on a single return driver.
Why Is It Important?
Factor investing is central to modern portfolio theory and has several advantages:
● Evidence-Based: Factors are supported by decades of academic and practitioner research
(e.g., Fama-French models, Carhart 4-factor, AQR studies)
● Transparent & Repeatable: Rules-based screening removes subjectivity and supports
model discipline
● Diversification: Each factor performs differently across cycles, so blending them reduces
portfolio volatility
● Customizable: Factor exposures can be tailored to investor preferences (e.g., ESG
integration, sector limits)
Notable Studies:
● Fama & French (1993): Introduced Size and Value as risk-based factors
● Carhart (1997): Added Momentum as a behavioral factor

● Novy-Marx (2013): Identified Profitability (Quality) as a return-enhancing factor
How Is It Used in This Course?
Students in the Student Investment Fund apply factor investing in the following ways:
● Factor-Based Screens: Construct models using valuation, performance, and quality filters
to identify high-potential stocks
● Multi-Factor Models: Combine value, momentum, and quality to rank stocks and create
sector-neutral portfolios
● Backtesting: Evaluate factor performance across different periods and market regimes
(bull, bear, recession, expansion)
● Portfolio Tilts: Compare fund exposures to the benchmark and suggest rebalances based
on factor strength
● Stock Pitch Validation: Use factor scores to support or challenge discretionary
investment theses
Example: A student group might build a model that selects the top decile of S&P 500 stocks
ranked by a composite score (40% Value, 30% Momentum, 30% Quality), rebalanced quarterly,
and compare its Sharpe Ratio against the benchmark.
Mean Reversion
Mean Reversion Strategies
What Is It?
Mean reversion is a systematic investment strategy based on the belief that asset prices and
valuation metrics tend to revert to their long-term historical average over time. These strategies
seek to capitalize on short-term mispricings by betting that unusually high or low prices will
eventually move back toward a central tendency.
Mean reversion works best in range-bound or low-volatility markets, where asset prices exhibit
oscillating behavior around a mean.
Common Mean Reversion Strategies
● Pairs Trading: Identify two historically correlated assets (e.g., Coca-Cola and Pepsi).
When their price relationship diverges, buy the underperformer and short the
outperformer, expecting the spread to revert to the mean.
● Bollinger Bands: Price bands based on standard deviations around a moving average.
When a stock price breaches the upper or lower band, it may signal a reversal.
● Price-to-Average Signals: Buy when the price is significantly below its moving average
(e.g., 20-day SMA) and sell when above.

Why Is It Important?
● Corrects Inefficiencies: Identifies overreactions and mispricings in the short term.
● Market Neutrality: Many mean reversion strategies are long/short and uncorrelated to
broader market movements.
● Risk Control: Strategies often include tight stop-losses and defined entry/exit conditions
based on z-scores or thresholds.
Example: A stock trading 2 standard deviations below its 60-day mean may be flagged for a long
trade, with an exit triggered once it reverts to the average.
How Is It Used in This Course?
Students in the Student Investment Fund:
● Backtest mean reversion models on historical price data across sectors
● Tune parameters such as lookback windows, standard deviation thresholds, and z-scores
● Use tools like Excel, Python, or Bloomberg to identify reversion setups
● Compare performance across different time frames and market regimes
● Assess strategy effectiveness based on Sharpe ratio, drawdown, and hit rate
Arbitrage
What Is It?
Arbitrage strategies seek to exploit pricing inefficiencies between related assets to generate low-
risk or risk-free profits. While true arbitrage is rare, many forms of arbitrage rely on statistical
relationships or event-driven pricing gaps.
Types of Arbitrage Strategies
Why Is It Important?
● Market-Neutral Exposure: Arbitrage strategies are often hedged, meaning they are
relatively unaffected by broad market trends.

● Volatility-Friendly: Many arbitrage strategies thrive during market dislocations or
periods of heightened uncertainty.
● Diversification Tool: Useful for building uncorrelated return streams in a broader
portfolio.
Example: In a merger arbitrage scenario, if Company A announces it will acquire Company B
for $50/share and Company B is trading at $47, the arbitrage spread ($3) represents potential
profit if the deal closes.
How Is It Used in This Course?
Students in this course:
● Analyze real M&A announcements to simulate merger arbitrage trades and calculate
expected return, deal break risk, and arbitrage spread
● Explore volatility arbitrage techniques through implied vs. realized volatility differentials
● Discuss arbitrage in the context of market efficiency, transaction costs, and timing risk
Economic Strategies
What Is It?
Economic strategies are top-down investment approaches that adjust sector exposures, asset
allocations, or portfolio weights based on macroeconomic indicators and phases of the business
cycle. These strategies operate on the principle that economic conditions—such as GDP growth,
inflation, interest rates, and employment—influence the relative performance of different asset
classes and sectors over time.
By analyzing the current and projected state of the economy, investors aim to position portfolios
to benefit from favorable macroeconomic tailwinds or shield against adverse shifts.
Common Economic Strategy Examples

Economic strategies can also involve cross-asset rotation, such as shifting between equities and
bonds or increasing allocations to real assets when inflation expectations rise.
Key Economic Indicators Used
Students may use the following indicators to guide strategic shifts:
Why Is It Important?
● Top-Down Framework: Provides a structured lens to interpret market behavior in the
context of the macro environment.
● Predictive Power: Anticipates sector rotation patterns based on economic momentum and
expectations.
● Diversification by Cycle: Aligns exposures with macro tailwinds while avoiding sectors
most vulnerable to economic shifts.
● Relevance for Asset Allocation: Macroeconomic signals guide not just sector weights,
but also asset class mix (e.g., equities vs. fixed income vs. commodities).
Example: A rise in CPI and PPI may prompt a strategy to overweight energy and materials,
while reducing exposure to long-duration growth stocks sensitive to rate hikes.
How Is It Used in This Course?
In the Student Investment Fund, students incorporate economic strategies in several ways:
● Macroeconomic Research: Students monitor real-time macro data releases (e.g., Fed
announcements, unemployment reports) and translate insights into portfolio adjustments.

● Sector Rotation Models: Students build systematic allocation models that shift exposure
based on macroeconomic thresholds or business cycle classification.
● Backtesting: Strategies are tested across historical periods using macro triggers (e.g., PMI
< 50, inflation > 3%) to determine optimal sector weights.
● Portfolio Commentary: Economic reasoning is integrated into pitch decks, justifying
allocations through macro perspectives (e.g., overweighting financials due to rising
interest rates).
● Business Cycle Mapping: Teams identify the current phase of the cycle using indicators
and construct portfolios designed for that specific macro regime.
Why is it important?
Macroeconomic variables drive asset class performance over time and provide a top-down view
for portfolio positioning.
How to Backtest a Strategy
What Is It?
Backtesting is the process of evaluating a trading or investment strategy by applying it to
historical data. The goal is to simulate how the strategy would have performed in the past, using
predefined rules for entry, exit, position sizing, and risk management.
Backtesting is a foundational tool in quantitative finance, systematic investing, and portfolio
management, allowing investors to assess the viability and robustness of a strategy before
committing real capital.
Why Is It Important?
● Risk Reduction: Helps avoid capital loss by identifying poorly performing or overfitted
strategies before real-world execution.
● Performance Insight: Reveals historical return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, drawdowns,
turnover, and other critical metrics.
● Strategy Validation: Tests whether an investment idea has empirical support.
● Scenario Testing: Allows users to explore how strategies perform in different market
environments (e.g., bull markets, recessions, rate hikes).
● Iterative Improvement: Enables tuning and refining strategies based on evidence—not
guesswork.
A good backtest doesn’t guarantee future performance, but a poor backtest almost always
predicts failure.
Steps to Backtest a Strategy

1. Define Strategy Rules
Specify exact logic and conditions for:
● Entry/Exit criteria: Based on technicals (e.g., RSI < 30), fundamentals (e.g., low P/E), or
macro triggers (e.g., inflation > 3%)
● Position sizing: Equal weight? Risk parity? Dollar-neutral?
● Holding period: Intraday, daily, weekly, etc.
● Risk limits: Max drawdown, stop-losses, sector caps
Example: Buy the top 5 momentum stocks in the S&P 500 each month (12-month return), hold
for 1 month, and rebalance monthly.
2. Collect Clean Historical Data
Reliable backtests require accurate and survivorship-bias-free data. Common sources:
● Price data: Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, Quandl, Polygon.io
● Fundamentals: S&P Capital IQ, FactSet, WRDS
● Macroeconomic indicators: FRED, Bloomberg ECOS
Ensure:
● No lookahead bias (only use data available at the time)
● Adjusted prices for splits/dividends
● Proper handling of delisted companies (avoid survivorship bias)
3. Apply Strategy Logic
Code the strategy using:
● Python (pandas, backtrader, zipline)
● Excel with VBA or Power Query
● Bloomberg Terminal (BT <GO> or EQBT <GO>)
The strategy logic should loop through time series data, simulate trades based on rules, and
record portfolio values.
4. Track Performance Metrics
Evaluate the strategy using key indicators:

.
5. Visualize and Analyze Results
Use charts and visual aids to interpret strategy behavior:
● Equity curve: Portfolio value over time
● Drawdown plot: When and how much the portfolio declined
● Rolling Sharpe or return: Stability across periods
● Exposure or allocation chart: Where capital was deployed
Then diagnose performance:
● Does the strategy work consistently?
● Did it outperform in certain regimes (e.g., high volatility)?
● Are there obvious overfitting signs (perfect backtest but poor out-of-sample results)?
How Is It Used in This Course?
In the Student Investment Fund, students are expected to:
● Develop their own systematic strategies, from entry logic to sizing and exit rules
● Write backtesting code in Python, Excel, or Bloomberg to simulate performance
● Evaluate results using performance metrics, stress tests, and scenario analysis

● Present findings in pitch decks, explaining the rationale, backtest assumptions, and
limitations
Example: A team might propose a long-only, sector-rotating strategy based on PMI and inflation
levels, backtested across 15 years with sector ETFs. Their analysis includes Sharpe ratio,
turnover, and recession-period performance.
Students are also taught to:
● Detect overfitting: Look for strategies that rely on too many parameters or curve-fit to the
past
● Use out-of-sample testing: Validate strategy on unseen data
● Consider execution factors: Such as slippage, bid-ask spread, and market impact

Students may be asked to include Bloomberg screenshots or outputs in pitch decks and performance
reports to support their investment theses.
Equity Screening in Bloomberg Terminal
What Is It?
Equity screening in Bloomberg refers to the use of the EQS <GO> (Equity Screening) function, a
powerful tool that allows users to filter and identify companies based on a wide range of financial,
operational, and qualitative attributes. The screen can be tailored using hundreds of data points across:
● Valuation metrics (e.g., P/E, EV/EBITDA, Price/Book)
● Fundamentals (e.g., revenue growth, return on equity, debt ratios)
● Market characteristics (e.g., market cap, sector, region)
● Analyst sentiment (e.g., consensus rating, price targets)
● Technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI)
● ESG scores (MSCI, S&P, or Bloomberg proprietary)
● Ownership and insider activity
These filters can be layered to create dynamic stock screens that update in real time and adapt to changing
market conditions.
Why Is It Important?
● Accelerates Investment Idea Generation: Narrow thousands of global stocks down to a
manageable watchlist that fits specific strategic criteria.
● Integrates Quantitative and Qualitative Criteria: Investors can combine hard financial data with
softer indicators like ESG scores or news sentiment.
● Customizable and Repeatable: Screens can be saved, exported, and refined over time, allowing
for consistency and scalability in investment research.

● Data Integrity and Depth: Bloomberg provides real-time and historical data with extensive quality
controls, trusted by institutions worldwide.
How Is It Used in This Course?
Students in the Student Investment Fund (SIF) use the EQS <GO> function to:
● Support Stock Pitches: Create screens that isolate companies matching investment theses,
whether value, growth, or ESG-focused.
● Construct Factor-Based Strategies: Build multi-factor models using screens based on momentum,
quality, size, or volatility factors.
● Perform Peer Comparisons: Identify direct competitors to evaluate relative valuation or industry
positioning.
● Apply ESG Filters: Integrate sustainability metrics into the screening process for portfolios
aligned with ESG mandates.
● Backtest Screen Logic: While EQS is not a backtesting tool, students may export screen results
into Excel and compare historical performance using Bloomberg Excel Add-In.
Economic Data in Bloomberg
What Is It?
The Bloomberg Terminal provides comprehensive access to real-time and historical macroeconomic data
from countries around the world. Through dedicated functions like ECON <GO>, WECO <GO>, and
FOMC <GO>, users can monitor key indicators that include:
● GDP growth
● Inflation rates (CPI, PCE, PPI)
● Labor market data (unemployment, nonfarm payrolls)
● Interest rates (Federal Funds Rate, 10-Year Treasury, LIBOR)
● Central bank policy decisions (FOMC, ECB, BoE)
● Consumer confidence, PMI, housing starts, and more
Bloomberg sources this data directly from government agencies, central banks, and global organizations
(e.g., IMF, OECD), and updates it in real-time, with historical time series available for backtesting or
charting.
Why Is It Important?
● Macro trends drive asset class returns: Economic conditions affect the performance of equities,
fixed income, real assets, and currencies.
● Sector rotation depends on business cycles: For example, technology and industrials often
outperform during expansions, while utilities and healthcare shine during contractions.
● Monetary policy shifts impact valuations and capital flows: Interest rate expectations guide
investor decisions about duration, equity multiples, and FX risk.
● Forecasting tools for market positioning: Economic data helps anticipate inflection points, such as
recessions, recoveries, and tightening cycles.

Example: Rising CPI and falling consumer confidence may lead to overweighting consumer staples and
underweighting discretionary spending sectors.
How Is It Used in This Course?
Students in the Student Investment Fund (SIF) use Bloomberg’s economic data tools to:
● Analyze the business cycle: Identify the current macroeconomic phase (expansion, peak,
contraction, recovery) using time-series visualizations of key indicators
● Build economic strategy models: Use macro indicators (e.g., PMI, unemployment, inflation) to
trigger changes in sector weights or asset allocations
● Support investment theses: Justify stock or sector pitches with economic context (e.g., overweight
energy based on inflation and geopolitical shocks)
● Download historical data: Pull macroeconomic series into Excel or Python via the Bloomberg
Excel Add-In for backtesting and regression analysis
● Monitor upcoming data releases: Track the economic calendar to anticipate volatility or make
allocation changes before key events
Key Bloomberg Functions for Economic Data
Company Specific Data and Financials in Bloomberg
What Is It?
Company-specific data refers to the comprehensive set of financial, operational, and organizational
information available for publicly traded companies. This includes:
● Company profile: Business summary, industry classification, key products/services
● Financial statements: Income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement
● Key financial ratios: Return on equity (ROE), debt-to-equity, EBITDA margin, etc.
● Consensus estimates: Analyst projections for revenue, EPS, and guidance
● Capital structure: Breakdown of debt, equity, and cost of capital
● Management and governance: Executive team bios, board composition, compensation
Why Is It Important?

● Core to Valuation: DCF, relative valuation, and other models depend on accurate historical and
projected data.
● Risk Assessment: Leverage, margin trends, and earnings volatility shape an investor's risk profile
of a firm.
● Pitch Foundation: Investment recommendations rely heavily on clear, defensible financial
analysis.
● Peer Benchmarking: Evaluating a company against sector averages or competitors helps identify
strengths, weaknesses, and pricing inefficiencies.
● Due Diligence: Understanding the full financial and strategic position of a company is essential
before allocating capital.
Example: A company may appear undervalued based on trailing P/E, but declining gross margins or high
leverage might signal deeper operational risks.
How Is It Used in This Course?
Students in the Student Investment Fund (SIF) frequently access and analyze company-level data to:
● Build Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) models: Pull 3–5 years of historical financials and 5–10
years of forward projections based on analyst estimates and company guidance.
● Perform comparative analysis: Use tools like RV <GO> or peer comp tables in Excel to compare
valuation multiples across companies in the same industry.
● Conduct profitability and risk analysis: Track trends in margins, free cash flow, leverage ratios,
and coverage metrics.
● Screen for investment ideas: Use metrics like high ROIC, low P/E, or positive EPS surprises to
narrow the investable universe.
● Prepare investment memos and pitches: Cite financial ratios and KPIs to support buy/hold/sell
recommendations.
Bloomberg Terminal Shortcuts for Company Data
Backtesting in Bloomberg
What Is It?

Backtesting is the process of evaluating an investment strategy by applying it to historical data to see how
it would have performed. Bloomberg offers integrated backtesting capabilities through functions such as:
● PORT <GO>: Portfolio performance and attribution analysis
● BT <GO>: Bloomberg Strategy Backtesting tool (if enabled by your institution)
● EQBT <GO>: Equity Backtest Tool (for factor-based or signal-driven strategies)
These tools allow users to simulate strategies over custom time frames using real market data, portfolio
holdings, and quantitative signals.
Why Is It Important?
Backtesting is critical in both professional investing and academic research because it allows you to:
● Reduce live risk: Identify and eliminate poor strategies before capital is deployed.
● Assess performance: Evaluate return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, turnover, and alpha
generation.
● Improve decision-making: Understand under which conditions the strategy performs best (e.g.,
rising rates, recessions, high volatility).
● Avoid overfitting: Spot models that are too closely tailored to past data and unlikely to perform
well out-of-sample.
● Benchmark ideas: Compare new strategies against passive benchmarks (e.g., S&P 500) or
existing models.
Backtesting turns theory into evidence. Without it, investment strategies remain unvalidated hypotheses.
How Is It Used in This Course?
Students in the Student Investment Fund (SIF) are expected to build and test systematic investment
strategies, often using a combination of:
● Bloomberg’s built-in tools (PORT, EQBT, BT)
● Custom Excel models with Bloomberg Add-In
● Python scripts using price, factor, and macroeconomic data exported from Bloomberg
Use cases include:
● Backtesting a factor model: For example, a screen based on high ROE and low P/E stocks, tested
from 2010–2024.
● Testing macro strategies: Shifting sector allocations based on PMI or inflation levels.
● Evaluating ESG integration: Comparing performance of screened ESG portfolios vs. traditional
benchmarks.
● Portfolio stress testing: Seeing how a strategy would have performed during market downturns
like COVID-19 (2020) or the 2008 financial crisis.
Students are encouraged to test strategies across multiple time periods and market regimes to evaluate
robustness and stability.

Backtesting Tools in Bloomberg
Example Project in SIF
A team designs a value-plus-quality strategy, screening for companies with:
● P/E < 15
● ROE > 10%
● Debt/Equity < 0.5
They use EQS <GO> to run the screen, export the results via Excel Add-In, and then backtest the returns
using Python or Excel over a 5-year period. They analyze:
● Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
● Sharpe Ratio
● Annual turnover
● Comparison vs. S&P 500 benchmark
Their findings support or revise their pitch before proposing the strategy for inclusion in the SIF portfolio.

How Is It Used in This Course?
● Run custom screens to identify stock pitch candidates
● Create systematic models based on multi-factor filters
● Backtest past screen results using historical datasets
Example: A screen might identify mid-cap consumer stocks with positive EPS revisions, low leverage,
and ROE above 15%, forming the foundation of a long-only strategy.
Excel Integration
What Is It?
Excel integration allows students to build custom company screening tools using financial data exported
directly into Excel or dynamically linked via platforms like the S&P Capital IQ Excel Plug-In. These
models enable users to filter and rank companies based on user-defined financial criteria, such as
valuation multiples, profitability, leverage, growth, or factor scores.
This approach offers full control over:
● Screening logic
● Sorting and ranking methodology
● Backtesting windows
● Custom weighting of metrics
Example: A student might create a screen that selects companies with ROE > 15%, EV/EBITDA < 10x,
and 1-year price return in the top quartile of their sector.
Why Is It Important?
● Customizability: Enables precise screening based on the portfolio’s philosophy or strategy goals.
● Flexibility: Screens can be adjusted quickly for different time frames, sectors, or market
conditions.
● Advanced modeling: Supports integration of custom metrics (e.g., ESG-adjusted profitability or
composite factor scores).
● Data transparency: Students can audit and modify every input and formula, enhancing
understanding.
Unlike prebuilt screeners, Excel-based screening gives students the opportunity to think critically about
which metrics matter most and how to structure them into a repeatable, systematic process.
How Is It Used in This Course?
Students in the SIF course use Excel integration for:
● Building custom equity screens using fundamental data pulled via CapIQ or FactSet

● Ranking companies based on weighted factor scores (e.g., 40% valuation, 30% quality, 30%
momentum)
● Automating peer comparisons across valuation and performance metrics
● Preparing investment pitch shortlists based on screen output
● Testing systematic strategies across historical time periods by refreshing data and observing how
screens would have performed
This practice builds practical Excel skills while reinforcing financial modeling logic and investment
reasoning.
Data Analysis & Financial Modeling in Excel & Google Sheets
What Is It?
Financial modeling is the process of creating structured, spreadsheet-based representations of a
company’s financial performance. These models support decision-making for valuation, forecasting,
sensitivity testing, and risk analysis. In this course, students use Excel and Google Sheets to build tools
such as:
● Three-statement financial models
● Discounted cash flow (DCF) valuations
● Football field valuation charts
● Backtesting and screening spreadsheets
● Scenario and sensitivity tables
These models rely on clean formatting, logical structures, and consistent conventions to ensure clarity,
accuracy, and professionalism.
Why Is It Important?
● Excel fluency is a core skill for finance professionals—used in investment banking, equity
research, asset management, and private equity.
● Enables data-driven insights for investment decisions
● Facilitates scenario planning and stress testing
● Promotes transparency and collaboration, especially in group environments
● Teaches the discipline of precision and auditability, key for professional presentations
In the real world, poor model hygiene can lead to flawed valuations, costly mistakes, and lost credibility.
How Is It Used in This Course?
Students are expected to:
● Build models from scratch or adapt templates to reflect new assumptions
● Populate models with real data pulled from Bloomberg, CapIQ, FactSet, or financial filings
● Use models to justify investment pitches and rebalance fund positions
● Submit spreadsheets that are clean, auditable, and follow formatting standards

In particular, all models must follow the SIF formatting conventions, described below.
Model Formatting: Color Coding Standards
Students must use this color coding in all submissions, including DCFs, peer comps, and earnings models.
Hardcoding vs. Formulas
What Is It?
● Hardcoding: Typing a value directly into a cell (e.g., “7.5%”)
● Formulas: Dynamically calculating values based on inputs (e.g., =B2*B3)
Why Is It Important?
● Overuse of hardcoding makes models rigid, non-scalable, and error-prone
● Formulas allow for scenario testing, sensitivity analysis, and automated updates
● Best practice is to hardcode only assumptions, not outputs
How Is It Used in This Course?
● Students are taught to minimize hardcoded values
● All key assumptions should be clearly labeled and isolated
● Formulas should be used wherever possible to promote transparency and flexibility
Example: Instead of hardcoding EBITDA, link it to the income statement using =Revenue – COGS –
SG&A.
Excel & Google Sheets Functions
Overview
Excel and Google Sheets serve as the backbone of financial modeling, portfolio tracking, and
data analysis in both academic and professional settings. Mastering spreadsheet functions allows

analysts to manipulate data efficiently, create dynamic investment tools, and conduct real-time
research.
In this course, students leverage spreadsheet functions to:
● Build automated models and dashboards
● Perform backtesting and historical analysis
● Merge datasets and extract key metrics
● Summarize results in structured, decision-ready formats
Key Functions & Their Applications
Best Practices
● Use INDEX/MATCH instead of VLOOKUP for more robust models
● Ensure dynamic referencing using named ranges or tables for expanding datasets
● Combine functions (e.g., IFERROR, SUMIFS, XLOOKUP, FILTER) to build layered
logic
● Use Pivot Tables in conjunction with slicers and data validation to build interactive
dashboards
