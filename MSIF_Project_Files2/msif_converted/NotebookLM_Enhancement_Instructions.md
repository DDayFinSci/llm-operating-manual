# NotebookLM Instructions for MSIF Pitch Feedback Enhancement

## OBJECTIVE
Refine two systematic strategy pitch feedback paragraphs using actual slide content and faculty feedback patterns.

## SOURCE FILES REQUIRED
### Core Documents (Must Have)
1. `quantum returns 11-10 systematic strategy - slide deck.pdf`
2. `4 risketeers 11-10 systematic strategy slide deck.pdf`
3. `FINAL_Grade_Feedback__Cash_Flow_Crew_Systematic_Pitch_113.pdf`
4. `FINAL_Grade_Feedback__Ute_Capital_Systematic_Pitch_113.pdf`

### Supporting Documents (If Available)
5. `NBER.pdf` (Novy-Marx source paper)
6. `sourcepaper_4risketeers_syspitch_frazziniandpedersen.pdf`
7. `Cash_Flow_Crew_9825_Pitch__Final_Grade__Feedback.pdf`
8. Any other "Final_Grade" or "FINAL_Grade_Feedback" PDFs

## ENHANCEMENT TASK

### Step 1: Extract Specific Pitch Content
For each pitch deck, identify:
- Actual backtest results (returns, Sharpe, alpha, correlations)
- Screening criteria and rebalancing frequency
- Benchmark used (critical - was it S&P 500 or appropriate factor benchmark?)
- Recommendation and rationale given
- Visual/presentation weaknesses

### Step 2: Map Faculty Voice Pattern
From graded feedback forms, extract:
- Typical paragraph length (usually 3-4 sentences per topic)
- Common critique patterns (acknowledge strength → identify weakness → provide specific correction)
- Quantitative threshold references (what alpha/Sharpe levels trigger criticism?)
- Preferred terminology for systematic strategies

### Step 3: Enhance Existing Feedback
Using Claude's draft feedback as base:
1. **Replace generic observations with specific quantitative critiques**
   - Change: "Your backtest results..."
   - To: "Your backtest generated [X%] alpha with [Y] Sharpe ratio..."

2. **Add slide-specific corrections**
   - "Slide 7's correlation matrix shows 0.83 overlap with existing systematic positions"
   - "The rebalancing frequency assumption (quarterly) conflicts with stated turnover"

3. **Match faculty severity patterns**
   - If prior feedback shows Brogaard/TAs emphasize certain errors more heavily, mirror that weighting

### Step 4: Maintain Voice Consistency
Preserve Darrell Professional Voice v3:
- 3-4 sentences per analytical point
- One paragraph per major critique area
- Empathy → Insight → Directive structure
- Composed, pedagogically constructive tone

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Produce two refined paragraphs (250-300 words each) that:
1. Reference specific slide numbers and data points
2. Use faculty terminology from graded forms
3. Provide actionable corrections tied to framework gates
4. Maintain consistent voice with Claude's framework audit

## CRITICAL FOCUS AREAS
- **Benchmark mismatch** - Did they use S&P 500 for defensive strategy?
- **Factor attribution** - Do they understand what drives returns?
- **Portfolio integration** - Did they check correlation with existing positions?
- **Do Not Buy logic** - Is rejection due to rules, timing, or redundancy?
