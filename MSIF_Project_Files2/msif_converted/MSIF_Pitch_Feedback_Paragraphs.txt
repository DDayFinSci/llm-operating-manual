# MSIF Pitch Feedback Paragraphs

## Pitch A: Quantum Returns — Defensive Sector Systematic Strategy

Your presentation demonstrated strong conceptual understanding of the defensive equity literature, particularly in recognizing that Novy-Marx's critique doesn't invalidate defensive outperformance but rather reframes its source. The screening criteria you developed — Beta < 1, ROIC > 9%, EPS CAGR > 13%, Market Cap > $10B, P/E < 20 — appropriately operationalize the paper's insight that defensive premiums derive from embedded profitability and value factors rather than low beta itself. Your correspondence with Professor Brogaard shows intellectual honesty in confronting the paper's skepticism and adjusting your interpretation accordingly.

The critical weakness lies in benchmark selection and performance attribution. A defensive strategy benchmarked against the S&P 500 will naturally show muted returns during risk-on regimes — this reflects the strategy's design, not failure. The appropriate comparison would be MSCI USA Minimum Volatility or a defensive equity index that matches your factor exposures. Your Do Not Buy recommendation appears justified if the strategy fails to generate alpha against the *correct* benchmark, but this distinction must be explicit. The recommendation should clarify whether you're rejecting the strategy because (1) the rules themselves lack validity, (2) the rules are valid but current market conditions don't trigger entry, or (3) the rules trigger but portfolio integration analysis reveals redundancy with existing positions.

Moving forward, consider running factor regression analysis on your backtest results to quantify how much return derives from market beta versus quality, value, and size exposures. This would validate whether your screens successfully capture Novy-Marx's "unprofitable small growth exclusion" that drives defensive outperformance. Additionally, document portfolio-level impact: does adding this strategy reduce overall portfolio volatility or Sharpe ratio? The systematic framework's value lies not in standalone metrics but in portfolio contribution. Your intellectual engagement with the source material is commendable — now ensure your quantitative analysis matches that rigor.

## Pitch B: 4 Risketeers — Betting Against Beta Strategy

Your selection of Frazzini & Pedersen's seminal work demonstrates sound theoretical grounding in the low-beta anomaly. The paper's core insight — that leverage constraints force investors into high-beta assets, creating systematic mispricing of low-beta securities — provides a persistent inefficiency with clear economic rationale. This represents exactly the type of academically validated, structurally persistent opportunity that systematic strategies should exploit.

The execution challenge for a Betting Against Beta implementation within MSIF's constraints requires careful consideration. The original paper employs leverage and short positions to create market-neutral exposure, neither of which are available to the fund. Your adaptation to a long-only, low-beta tilt represents a pragmatic compromise, but you must acknowledge this materially changes expected returns and risk characteristics. Without leverage to equalize market exposure, your strategy will underperform during bull markets by design — not deficiency. The framework requires you to demonstrate superior risk-adjusted returns against an appropriate low-volatility benchmark, not raw outperformance against the S&P 500.

Your Do Not Buy recommendation needs clearer classification within the systematic framework's three-part logic: are you concluding that (1) long-only BAB cannot capture sufficient alpha without leverage, (2) current market conditions with elevated valuations don't favor defensive positioning, or (3) the fund already has adequate low-volatility exposure through existing positions? Each conclusion requires different supporting evidence. If the issue is structural (inability to implement BAB without shorts/leverage), acknowledge this as an implementation constraint rather than strategy invalidity. If timing-based, specify what market conditions would trigger entry. If redundancy-based, provide correlation analysis with current holdings. The discipline of systematic investing lies in following predetermined rules even when discretionary judgment might suggest otherwise — ensure your recommendation reflects this principle rather than defaulting to rejection due to complexity or recent underperformance.
