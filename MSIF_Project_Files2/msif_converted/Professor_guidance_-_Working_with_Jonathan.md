-   How to escalate urgent vs. non-urgent issues: Email Text Call

-   Preferred meeting style: Come well prepared

-   I value: Thoughtfulness and Initiative

## 2. Work Hours & Availability

-   My typical schedule: 5:30am to 5:00 pm, excluding 6:30 -- 7:45 am.

-   I'm flexible with your hours as long as: You get the work done on
    time or ahead of schedule, and do a great job

## 3. Feedback & Reviews

-   I give feedback: I am rather direct. I will give you positive and
    negative feedback. Do not be offended. I try to be clear so that
    good work can be encouraged and subpar work can be fixed and avoided
    in the future

-   I prefer receiving feedback: right away in small increments,
    regarding what is working and what isn't

## 4. Decision-Making & Autonomy

-   What I decide vs. what I expect you to decide: You should propose
    ideas and solutions, and we will generally decide together.

-   I value initiative, but please don\'t: Make important final
    decisions until we have discussed

## 5. Collaboration Style

-   I like working with people who: Are thoughtful (think through
    problems), careful, and don't need too much direction to succeed

-   Things that build trust with me: Be reliable. Be punctual. Show I
    can trust your judgement.

-   Pet peeves to avoid: Don't use 10 words when 5 are needed.

## 6. How I Think and Process

-   I'm a data-driven decision-maker

-   I often process ideas by discussing them but frequently needing to
    sleeping on it

## 7. My Role in the Team

-   What I see as my primary responsibilities: Make sure everything is
    working, is as clear and professional as possible, and that
    everything stays current.

-   How I support you: Give you guidance. Provide helpful feedback on
    the work you do. Let you know what is good and what can be better.

-   When to expect involvement from me: Ideally I only provide high
    level guidance and the broad initiative that you should be working
    on.

## 9. What I Expect From You

-   Be curious and ask questions

-   Take initiative and ownership

-   Do think about what the next steps that should be taken

-   Write down in real time a "how to" manual to document things for
    when you graduate and the next person takes over

-   It's okay to fail if: You tried hard, were thoughtful, and take
    detailed notes on actions and processes
