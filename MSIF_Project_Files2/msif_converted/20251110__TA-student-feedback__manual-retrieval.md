Finished reviewing your guys' deck. Nice work. Its clean and the literature tie-in is solid.Â 

With the little time you have before Monday, I think youâ€™ll get the most improvement by making it clear that you understand Novy-Marxâ€™s critique. Heâ€™s not anti-defensive; heâ€™s just saying the illusion of a low-beta â€œedgeâ€ is actually accounted for in profitability + value factors, and (importantly) he also excludes unprofitable small growth. Pretty sure you guys covered some of this in that email thread with Brogaard.

Maybe you already plan to say that out loud. Either way, it would probably help if you do... and you should also directly point out that your ROIC/P-E screens are intentional proxies, not just â€œlow beta good.â€Â 

Two final ideas:

If you have time, 1) drop in a (not-so-simple) 5-factor regression on that backtest to show whatâ€™s driving returns. This is DEFINITELY NOT REQUIRED, but would make you stand out... no one ever does it. 2) Consider attaching a short Bloomberg iteration log and one sensitivity (e.g., P/E 20â†’25) to show its obviously not curve-fit. Also there are some sell-side phrases here (e.g., â€œcompelling entry pointâ€) that could be trimmed out so your data can speak for itself.Â 

Oh, one final thing (sorry for the long text): When you frame your Do-Not-Buy recommendation, make sure youâ€™re tying it back to Novy-Marx so it doesnâ€™t sound like youâ€™re just saying â€œthe numbers didnâ€™t work.â€ Your backtest really does confirm a key point from that paper: once you control for profitability and valuation, defensive premiums disappear. Thatâ€™s a solid verification and I think it connects the Systematic framework nicely to the Fundamental ideas we focused on through the last round of pitches.Â 

But it needs to sound like you guys reached a conclusion through thesis validation, not fatigue, especially since the last two groups also landed on Do-Not-Buys. Framing it this way shows you understand the paper and kept standards high, even if the results weren't sexy. And tbh it also protects you from looking like you defaulted to a no-buy just because it was easier.

I think you guys are basically where you need to be. The overall direction is right. Maybe just tighten the causal story and the process evidence and youâ€™ll be golden. For all I know you already plan on covering a lot of this but it's just not represented in the visual deck... which would be good! Remember that feedback from last time - try to not rely on any lengthy reading from slides/notes. We want to see you reading only a few words or figures, if you must read at all. That feedback really was for your whole team, not any individual member(s). It's something we're emphasizing with the majority of teams in the MSIF right now.

More feedback below â€” youâ€™re definitely headed in the right direction, and I like much of what Iâ€™m seeing.

Just between us, Iâ€™m holding this team to a slightly higher standard. Youâ€™re capable, and I want to see what you can do if you push deeper.

1. **WACC Visual** â€“ Any chance you can re-export that screenshot at a higher resolution? Not a major issue, but it stands out visually.
2. **Balance of Upside vs. Downside** â€“ Your upside analysis is strong. The downside discussion feels lighter by comparison. Aim for equal analytical weight on both.
3. **Scenario Analysis** â€“ Right now, your bull and bear cases move in parallel with the base. It feels like youâ€™re treating scenarios as different math inputs rather than different worlds. The risks you outlined (tariffs, macro, competition) should translate into measurable impacts â€” margin compression, slower revenue, or higher CapEx.

Lean more on near-term realism: annualize recent quarterly trends, layer in management commentary from the MD&A, and build Year 1 from that base before projecting outward. If EPS or FCF never decline in your bear case, itâ€™s not a bear case â€” itâ€™s a gentler bull.

_P.S._ If you have time, add quick sensitivity tables for WACC and perpetuity growth. Not required, but valuable for testing valuation robustness.

Good work, team. Excited to see the live pitch.

Hi Team.Â 

I've taken a look at this DCF. I think we have a long way to go. Your base case has lululemon over doubling in size by 2030. That is extremely aggressive growth expectations for a company that been around for 27 years. I worry that, because they had a couple of years with outsized performance 2020-2024, you may be allowing those outliers undue influence in your future projections.

Why did they perform so well in those years? Was it the result of their own internal initiatives, or were the markets themselves simply bullish? Can we reasonably expect similar performance in future periods?Â 

My advice would be to focus on assumptions first, and allow those assumptions to naturally flow into your discounted cash flow model. Don't get the order mixed up.Â 

Without getting overly specific, I think there are some line items that you guys can tighten up here. We gave similar advice to another group yesterday: if we annualize Lululemon's recent quarterly performance, are they on track to hit the number you are projecting at the end of this fiscal year? If not, why are you projecting that number?Â 

Finally, take some time to really nail down your investment thesis. What do you believe will occur within this industry over the next 5 years, and how does the Company fit into that picture?

I think there's some valuable things we can learn from them - things that me and Ethan's cohort didn't do particularly well, either:Â 

1) It is important in your pitch that your purpose is as clear as possible. At the moment your pitch reads more like a draft list of metrics, but it isn't fueled by guiding principles or a core philosophy. I'd consider starting with a concise and unambiguous statement about MSIF's mission and values as they pertain to performance and risk management. Then logically introduce how each target metric supports that mission.Â 

2) I would also consider reorganizing your list of metrics and definitions so they are a bit more logical, e.g. performance metrics, risk parameters, exposure limits, governance and reporting... try to have clearly delineated categoriesÂ 

3) Don't feel like you have to use the word "suggestion" - its fine if you do, but you're in the drivers seat here. Feel free to take ownership of what your pitching and set hard numbers with firm rationale and tight wording.Â 

4) If you have the bandwidth, I'd maybe consider exploring what our process should be for monitoring and reporting risk. We have as of yet never had that type of a governance structure. Just an idea...Â 

5) Make sure that any time a metric is proposed in relation to a benchmark, that benchmark is explicitly defined, e.g. "Relative to the S&P's xyz ratio of 15%, our target ratio of <13% reflects our commitment to disciplined risk positioning."Â 

6) Don't be afraid to add a bit of narrative to your pitch!Â Â TLDR: you're on the right track! I think next steps are to contextualize the targets you've identified within a clear, confident, and professional mission/value statement or narrative for the MSIF

*Student Question: Is it reasonable to change the terminal growth rate between the three cases? We want to use 3%, 4%, 5% for the bear, base, and bull cases respectively. China GDP growth rate is currently 5%.*

TA Response: 5% still feels a little aggressive to me, ever for a Bull. 

China's GDP growth may be clocking in at that rate now, but I would question whether or not, in the long run, we can reasonably expect an operating business to perpetually match the growth of a developed nation and world leader.Â Â 

And if we use the PRC as a comparison, look how rapidly that growth rate has declined even over the last 15 yearsÂ Â Not to say you guys couldn't convince me if the argument was compelling enough... but it would have to be pretty solid or Brogaard may assume that you guys aren't fully grasping what a perpetual rate represents

I guess just to be clear - I do like that you aren't applying a constant terminal growth rate across all the cases. That's good. Also there's some semantic nuance when discussing this... if you meant a real terminal growth rate instead of a nominal one, then maybe.

*Student Follow Up Question: Understood. Are we expected to have a different EV/EBITDA multiple for each case?*

TA Response: 

I guess just to be clear - I do like that you aren't applying a constant terminal growth rate across all the cases. That's good. Also there's some semantic nuance when discussing this... if you meant a real terminal growth rate instead of a nominal one, then maybe.Â Â 

Yeah. The EV/EBITDA multiple needs to be different.Â Â 

Any metric that reflects market expectations/sentiment of the business needs to be different across the three scenarios

*Student Question: I made this with Ethan! And will see what the class think of my proposed colors:) also uploaded in teams! Let me know if you think I need to change anything.*

TA Response: 

This looks good! Glad to see you implemented the Top 5 / Bottom 5 structure. It makes the slide much easier for the class to process.

I donâ€™t see anything that needs to change visually on the slide itself. A few presentation tips to think about:

Portfolio updates can be challenging because the slide is visually dense and full of performance metrics that can feel abstract to your classmates. Thatâ€™s part of why portfolio updates often receive fewer questions than other pitch categories. Try to guide the audience directly to the numbers that actually matter.

A good example this week is the difference between raw return and risk-adjusted performance. While the portfolio posted a positive return of ~1.04%, the alpha of â€“0.60% tells us we underperformed relative to our benchmark after controlling for market exposure. The Sortino ratio helps illustrate the â€œpathâ€ of returns here. Itâ€™s particularly sensitive to downside volatility, which suggests we saw pockets of sharp drawdowns despite finishing positive. Highlighting that contrast will who you understand the "how" behind the numbers on the screen.Â 

The other common stumbling block in these updates is context. Youâ€™re reporting on a broad set of positions, many of which the other fund managers have never seen before. One way to stand out is to briefly call attention to a strategy that doesnâ€™t get discussed often. For example, people may be curious about â€œSml Cap Syn â€“ Sâ€ in the Top 5. Itâ€™s the only systematic strategy on the list, and our cohort is about to begin learning systematic methods.

Iâ€™ve attached last yearâ€™s pitch deck below in case you want a quick snapshot to prepare for questions.Â 

The TLDR; is basically that the thesis focused on profitable small- and mid-cap companies with strong momentum, filtered using a range-bound RSI to identify sustained price strength rather than short-term spikes. One interesting question to consider with the class is whether recent performance reflects the specific screen. Did the strategy identify a uniquely strong cohort? Or is small-cap momentum as a factor just performing well at the moment.

You donâ€™t need to go deep. Just being able to offer one or two sentences of context will set you apart and help the class connect the dots on why the strategy might be performing.

Don't get too stressed over it, it's a fun and relatively straightforward presentation. Focus on helping the room interpret the key risk-adjusted metrics, and highlight one or two interesting angles to keep people engaged. Youâ€™ll do great. Good luck!

*Student Question: Hi Darrell, thanks for reaching out and offering help! Really appreciate it! I finished my macro update and sorry for late update with you! I will update the Marco via team.Â Would you mind to check my work before uploading?*

TA Response: 

Hi Xiaobo,

Thanks for sharing your slideâ€”nice work. Overall youâ€™re on the right track. When building these weekly macro updates, the two areas to think about are (1) the clarity of the visual slide and (2) the framing you plan to emphasize when you speak.

On the visual side, everything looks clean. The only thing Iâ€™d adjust is the strange value labels on the Technology and Communication Services portion of the sector performance chart; they appear misaligned and could be distracting. Quick fix, but worth doing.Â 

On content, youâ€™ve selected good headlines. Now take the extra step and think about _why we care_ as investors. Brogaard will always push on this. For each bullet, ask yourself whether it reflects (a) a broader economic trend thatâ€™s influencing markets at scale, (b) something that may affect industries or businesses we currently hold exposure to, or (c) a forward-looking signal that could influence valuations if the market hasnâ€™t fully priced it in. If you can articulate the connection between the headline and an investment implication, even briefly, your update will land much stronger.

Separately, make sure youâ€™re ready for the usual speculation around the federal funds rate, especially given the recent inflation print. People like to test your read on the Fed, even in a short update.Â 

Given your background, you may also get questions about U.S.â€“China dynamics. Trump is meeting with ä¹ è¿‘å¹³ this Thursday in South Korea, and the relationship has been volatile over the past year. It might be worth preparing a short perspective that ties trade posture back to supply chains, global risk sentiment, or sector sensitivity. It doesnâ€™t need to be longâ€”just enough to show youâ€™re tracking it.

Donâ€™t overthink this. Itâ€™s a five-minute presentation, and you already have the right structure. Clean visuals, a few crisp â€œwhy we careâ€ angles, and I'm sure you'll do great. Good luck!

Hi Team,Â   
  
I would like to thank those of you who attended our FAÂ workshopÂ today. Your engagement and active participation were phenomenal.Â   
  
To those of you who requested a part 2: Ethan and I are more than happy to provide furtherÂ workshops both related to Fundamental Analysis as well as other topics relevant to the Fund! Please feel free to request any topics you are interested in exploring. We really value your feedback and input.Â 

Today, we focused on developing a strong conceptual understanding of the "_why"_Â in Fundamental Analysis. Remember: any number you come across on a financial statement, or choose to include in a model/DCF, ultimately represents a story.Â 

Rigorous analysis is an important tool. Having said that, try to remember that we are owners â€” not analysts. Take care not to become so buried in your model that you lose your sense of the asset's overall narrative. Our job isn't over until we have leveraged analysis into a singular decision: to purchase, or not to purchase.

Some final thoughts:Â   
1. Be ruthless in revealing, and stress testing, your implicit/explicit assumptions.Â â€‹  
2. Simplicity is great (preferred, even) so long as it is intentional. If you're using a linear growth rate to forecast revenue, you should be able to clearly explain why that approach was appropriate.

3. Take breaks for sanity checks. Every so often step back and ask yourself: do these numbers actually make sense? Or am I lost in the math and forgetting the real-life business?

  
That's all for now.Â   
  
Have a wonderful weekend!
