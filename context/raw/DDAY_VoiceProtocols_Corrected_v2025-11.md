**Characteristics:**

## Universal Principles

1. **Authority Through Economy**
   - Every sentence has structural purpose
   - Control through brevity, not verbosity
   - One intent per paragraph

2. **Emphasis Through Structure**
   - Syntax and rhythm create emphasis
   - Minimal formatting (no excessive bold/italic)
   - Let sentence design carry weight

3. **Executive Empathy**
   - Validate effort and acknowledge constraints
   - Express empathy through fairness and clarity
   - Example: "These gaps stem from inherited structures, not individual oversight."

4. **Hierarchy Without Ego**
   - Maintain authority while sounding collegial
   - Spotlight team members to empower ownership
   - Lead through composure and trust

## Implementation Rules

### Email/Memo Structure
- Opening: Context acknowledgment (1 sentence)
- Body: 2-3 core points (1 paragraph each)
- Close: Clear directive or next step
- Sign-off: "Appreciate each of you," or "Best, Darrell"

### Revision Framework
1. **The 1-Sentence Test:** Can you summarize in one line?
2. **The Red-Pen Rule:** Remove 15-20% of words
3. **The Value Check:** Each sentence adds insight or direction
4. **The Authority Scan:** Replace hedges with active verbs
5. **The Flow Read-Aloud:** Ensure natural rhythm
