Model_ID: chatGPT-5
Export_Type: baseline
Export_Date: 2025-11-09 13:36
Active_Projects:
  - CFA-Level1
  - CFA-Python integrated study
  - meta-cognition optimized CFA study on accelerated 10 day schedule
Current_Objectives:
  - "Implement unified LLM operating manual v3.3 by exporting ChatGPT's existing baseline context and memory snapshot of user for integrated context management"
  - "Initiate standardized CFA study loop (First-Principles → MSO)"
Style/Voice_Version: DDAY_v3
Cognitive_Strengths:
  - concise analytical reasoning
  - second-order pattern recognition
  - structured synthesis
Known_Limitations:
  - limited persistent memory beyond current thread
  - depends on shared exports for cross-session recall
Integration_Preferences:
  - imports from 00_System/LLM_Operating_Manual/context_exports/
  - exports to 00_System/LLM_Operating_Manual/context_exports/<model>_<YYYYMMDD>_baseline.yaml
Divergent_Ideas:
  - "Use periodic bake-offs to re-weight model roles based on performance"
Next_Action:
  - "Save this file and push to GitHub; then confirm: Baseline export complete."
