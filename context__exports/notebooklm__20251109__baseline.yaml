Style/Voice_Version: DDAY_v3
Active_Projects:
  - CFA-Level1
  - CFA-Python integrated study
  - meta-cognition optimized CFA study on accelerated 10 day schedule
Current_Objectives:
  - Implement unified LLM operating manual v3.3 by exporting Notebook.lm's existing baseline context and memory snapshot of user characteristics for integrated context management
  - Initiate standardized CFA study loop (First-Principles → MSO)

  Import_Path: 00_System/LLM_Operating_Manual/context_exports/
  Export_Format: 00_System/LLM_Operating_Manual/context_exports/<model>_<YYYYMMDD>_baseline.yaml
Divergent_Ideas:
  - Use periodic bake-offs to re-weight model roles based on performance
Cognitive_Profile:
  Strengths:
    - concise analytical reasoning [Query]
    - strong conceptual thinker [1]
    - second-order pattern recognition (e.g., multi-step causality) [2, 3]
    - structured synthesis [Query]
    - Accurate self-awareness/calibration (Trust confidence signals) [3, 4]
  Limitations:
    - limited persistent memory beyond current thread [Query]
    - depends on shared exports for cross-session recall [Query]
    - Systematic procedural gaps (not conceptual failures) [1, 2]
    - Time collapse under pressure due to attempted on-the-fly derivation [5, 6]
    - Moral substitution pattern used when Standards language is forgotten [6, 7]
Baseline_Performance:
  Mock_A_Score: 43% (78/180 correct) [8]
  Error_Distribution:
    Conceptual_Errors: 37% (38 instances) [9]
    Procedural_Errors: 30% (31 instances) [9]
    Terminology_Errors: 18% (18 instances) [9]
  High_Confidence_Error_Root_Causes:
    - Procedural gaps (e.g., Median calculation, semiannual adjustment errors) [10]
    - Conceptual gaps (e.g., Margin return calculation) [10]
  Confidence_Calibration:
    High: 57.1% accuracy (16/28) [4]
    Medium: 50.0% accuracy (18/36) [4]
    Low: 36.1% accuracy (30/83) [4]
Study_Plan_Context:
  Pacing_Rules_to_Enforce:
    - 2-Minute Rule (If no formula recalled within 2 minutes, mark and move) [11]
    - Calculator Fail-Safe (If TVM keys don't resolve in 1 minute, skip) [11]
  High_Priority_Weaknesses:
    - Derivatives (Conceptual: Cannot distinguish put vs. call; payoff/profit calculation) [12]
    - Fixed Income Duration (Conceptual + Terminology: Does not know definitions or formulas) [12]
    - Quant TVM (Procedural: Fails to adjust N/I/Y/PMT for periodicity/deferral) [12]
  Priority_Python_Builds:
    - notebooks/quant.ipynb: pv(), fv(), npv(), annuity_pv(periods_deferred=0), convert_apr() [13]
    - notebooks/derivatives.ipynb: call_payoff(), put_payoff(), call_profit(), put_profit(), visualization [14]
    - notebooks/fixed_income.ipynb: bond_price(), ytm_solver(), modified_duration(), macaulay_duration() [14]
  Reference_Sheets_to_Generate:
    - /reference_sheets/ethics_triggers.md (Standard I–VII summaries, decision tree) [15]
    - /reference_sheets/guess_heuristics.md (Fixed Income inverse price/yield, Ethics disclosure logic) [15]
Next_Action_Confirmation: "Save this file and push to GitHub; then confirm: Baseline export complete."
